<h2>CHAPTER I.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE WILD ROSE IS THE SWEETEST.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>I tell again the oldest
and the newest story
of all the world,&mdash;the
story of Invincible
Love!</p>
<p>This tale divine&mdash;ancient
as the beginning
of things, fresh and
young as the passing
hour&mdash;has forms and
names various as humanity.
The story of
Aspatria Anneys is but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
one of these,&mdash;one leaf from all the roses
in the world, one note of all its myriad
of songs.</p>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>Aspatria was born</span> at Seat-Ambar, an
old house in Allerdale. It had Skiddaw
to shelter it on the northwest; and it
looked boldly out across the Solway, and
into that sequestered valley in Furness
known as &#8220;the Vale of the Deadly
Nightshade.&#8221; The plant still grew there
abundantly, and the villagers still kept
the knowledge of its medical value taught
them by the old monks of Furness. For
these curious, patient herbalists had discovered
the blessing hidden in the fair,
poisonous amaryllis, long before modern
physicians called it &#8220;belladonna.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plant, with all its lovely relations,
had settled in the garden at Seat-Ambar.
Aspatria&#8217;s mother had loved them all:
the girl could still remember her thin
white hands clasping the golden jonquils
in her coffin. This memory was in her
heart, as she hastened through the lonely
place one evening in spring. It ought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
have been a pleasant spot, for it was full
of snowdrops and daffodils, and many
sweet old-fashioned shrubs and flowers;
but it was a stormy night, and the blossoms
were plashed and downcast, and all
the birds in hiding from the fierce wind
and driving rain.</p>
<p>She was glad to get out of the gray,
wet, shivery atmosphere, and to come into
the large hall, ruddy and glowing with fire
and candle-light. Her brothers William
and Brune sat at the table. Will was
counting money; it stood in small gold
and silver pillars before him. Brune was
making fishing-flies. Both looked up at
her entrance; they did not think words
necessary for such a little maid. Yet
both loved her; she was their only sister,
and both gave her the respect to which
she was entitled as co-heir with them of
the Ambar estate.</p>
<p>She was just sixteen, and not yet beautiful.
She was too young for beauty. Her
form was not developed; she would probably
gain two or three inches in height;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
and her face, though exquisitely modelled,
wanted the refining which comes either
from a multitude of complex emotions or
is given at once by some great heart-sorrow.
Yet she had fascination for those
capable of feeling her charm. Her large
brown eyes had their childlike clearness;
they looked every one in the face with its
security of good-will. Her mouth was a
tempting mouth; the lips had not lost
their bow-shape; they were red and pouting,
but withal ever ready to part. She
might have been born with a smile. Her
hair, soft and dark, had that rarest quality
of soft hair,&mdash;a tendency to make itself into
little curls and tendrils and stray down
the white throat and over the white brow;
yet it was carefully parted and confined
in two long braids, tied at the ends with
a black ribbon.</p>
<p>She wore a black dress. It was plainly
made, and its broad ruffle around the open
throat gave it an air of simplicity almost
childlike in effect. Her arms below the
elbows were uncovered, and her hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
were small and finely formed, as patrician
hands should be. There was no ring
upon them, and no bracelet above them.
She wore neither brooch nor locket, nor
ornament of any kind about her person;
only a daffodil laid against the snowy skin
of her bosom. Even this effect was not
the result of coquetry; it was a holy and
loving sentiment materialized.</p>
<p>Altogether, she was a girl quite in keeping
with the antique, homelike air of the
handsome room she entered; her look,
her manner, and even her speech had the
local stamp; she was evidently a daughter
of the land. Her brothers resembled her
after their masculine fashion. They were
big men, whom nature had built for the
spaces of the moors and mountains and
the wide entrances of these old Cumberland
homes. They would have been
pushed to pass through narrow city doorways.
A fine open-air colour was in their
faces; they had that confident manner
which great physical strength imparts, and
that air of conscious pride which is born
in lords of the soil.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>Indeed, William and Brune Anneys
made one understand how truthfully popular
nomenclature has called an Englishman
&#8220;John Bull.&#8221; For whoever has seen a
bull in its native pastures&mdash;proud, obstinate,
conscious of his strength, and withal
a little surly&mdash;must understand that there
is a taurine basis to the English character,
finely expressed by the national
appellation.</p>
<p>A great thing was to happen that hour,
and all three were as unconscious of the
approaching fate as if it was to be a part
of another existence. Squire William finished
his accounts, and played a game of
chess with his brother. Aspatria walked
up and down the hall, with her hands
clasped behind her, or sat still in the
Squire&#8217;s hearth-chair, with her dress lifted
a little in front, to let the pleasant heat
fall upon her ankles. She did not think
of reading or of sewing, or of improving
the time in any way. Perhaps she was
not as dependent on books as the women
of this generation. Aspatria&#8217;s mind was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
sensitive and observing; it lived very well
on its own ideas.</p>
<p>The storm increased in violence; the
rain beat against the windows, and the
wind howled at the nail-studded oak door,
as if it intended to blow it down. A big
ploughman entered the room, shyly pulled
his front hair, and looked with stolid inquiry
into his master&#8217;s face. The Squire
pushed aside the chess-board, rose, and
went to the hearth-stone; for he was young
in his authority, and he felt himself on
the hearth-stone to hold an impregnable
position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Steve Bell, what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be I to sow the high land next, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can have a face or back wind,
it will be best; if you have an elbow-wind,
you must give the land an extra half-bushel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be I to sow mother-of-corn<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> on the
east holme?&#8221;</p>
<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0001' id='Footnote_0001'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0001'><span class='label'>[1]</span></a>
<p>Clover.</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;It is matterless. Is it going to be a
flashy spring?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<div class='figright' style='width:324px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0020.jpg' alt='' title='' width='324' height='430' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;A right season,</span> sir,&mdash;plenty
of manger-meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is the weather?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rain is near past; it will
take up at midnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Aspatria,
who had
been sitting with
folded hands and
half-shut eyes,
straightened herself
suddenly,
and threw up her
head to listen.
There was certainly
the tramp
of a horse&#8217;s feet,
and in a moment
the door was
loudly and impatiently
struck
with the metal
handle of a riding-whip.</p>
<p>Steve Bell went to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
answer the summons; Brune trailed slowly
after him. Aspatria and the Squire heard
nothing on the hearth but a human voice
blown about and away by the wind. But
Steve&#8217;s reply was distinct enough,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You be wanting Redware Hall, sir?
Cush! it&#8217;s unsensible to try for it. The
hills are slape as ice; the becks are full;
the moss will make a mouthful of you&mdash;horse
and man&mdash;to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Squire went forward, and Aspatria
also. Aspatria lifted a candle, and carried
it high in her hand. That was the first
glimpse of her that Sir Ulfar Fenwick
had.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must stay at Seat-Ambar to-night,&#8221;
said William Anneys. &#8220;You cannot
go farther and be sure of your life.
You are welcome here heartily, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The traveller dismounted, gave his horse
to Steve, and with words of gratitude
came out of the rain and darkness into the
light and comfort of the home opened to
him. &#8220;I am Ulfar Fenwick,&#8221; he said,&mdash;&#8220;Fenwick
of Fenwick and Outerby; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
I think you must be William Anneys of
Ambar-Side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same, sir. This is my brother
Brune, and my sister Aspatria. You are
dreeping wet, sir. Come to my room and
change your clothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Ulfar bowed and smiled assent; and
the bow and the smile were Aspatria&#8217;s.
Her cheeks burned; a strange new life
was in all her veins. She hurried the
housekeeper and the servants, and she
brought out the silver and the damask,
and the famous crystal cup in its stand of
gold, which was the lucky bowl of Ambar-Side.
When Fenwick came back to the
hall, there was a feast spread for him; and
he ate and drank, and charmed every
one with his fine manner and his witty
conversation.</p>
<p>They sat until midnight,&mdash;an hour
strange to Seat-Ambar. No one native in
that house had ever seen it before, no one
ever felt its mysterious influence. Sir
Ulfar had been charming them with tales
of the strange lands he had visited, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
strange peoples who dwelt in them. He
had not spoken much to Aspatria, but it
was in her face he had found inspiration
and sympathy. For her young eyes
looked out with such eager interest, with
glances so seeking, so without guile and
misgiving, that their bright rays found a
corner in his heart into which no woman
had ever before penetrated. And she was
equally subjugated by his more modern
orbs,&mdash;orbs with that steely point of brilliant
light, generated by large experience
and varied emotion,&mdash;electric orbs, such
as never shone in the elder world.</p>
<p>When the clock struck twelve, Squire
Anneys rose with amazement. &#8220;Why, it
is strike of midnight!&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is
past all, how the hours have flown! But
we mustn&#8217;t put off sleeping-time any
longer. Good-night heartily to you, sir.
It will be many a long day till I forget this
night. What doings you have seen, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was talking thus to his guest, as he
led him to the guest-room. Aspatria still
stood by the dying fire. Brune rose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
silently, stretched his big arms, and said:
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be going likewise. You had best
remember the time of
night, Aspatria.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figleft' style='width:260px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_5' id='linki_5'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0024.jpg' alt='' title='' width='260' height='472' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;What do you</span> think
of him, Brune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fenwick! I wouldn&#8217;t
think too high of him.
One might have to come
down a peg or two. He
sets a good deal of store by
himself, I should say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and I are of two ways
of judging, Brune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind; time will let
light into all our ways of
judging.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went yawning upstairs and
Aspatria slowly followed. She was not
a bit sleepy. She was wider awake
than she had ever been before. Her
hands quivered like a swallow&#8217;s wings;
her face was rosy and luminous. She
removed her clothing, and unbraided her
hair and shook it loose over her slim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
shoulders. There was a smile on her lips
through all these preparations for sleep,&mdash;a
smile innocent and glad. Suddenly
she lifted the candle and carried it to the
mirror. She desired to look at herself,
and she blushed deeply as she gratified
the wish. Was she fair enough to please
this wonderful stranger?</p>
<p>It was the first time such a query had
ever come to her heart. She was inclined
to answer it honestly. Holding the light
slightly above her head, she examined her
claims to his regard. Her expressive face,
her starry eyes, her crimson, pouting lips,
her long dark hair, her slight, virginal
figure in its gown of white muslin scantily
trimmed with English thread-lace, her
small, bare feet, her air of childlike, curious
happiness,&mdash;all these things, taken
together, pleased and satisfied her desires,
though she knew not how or why.</p>
<p>Then she composed herself with intentional
earnestness. She must &#8220;say her
prayers.&#8221; As yet it was only saying prayers
with Aspatria,&mdash;only a holy habit. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
large Book of Common Prayer stood open
against an oaken rest on a table; a cushion
of black velvet was beneath it. Ere she
knelt, she reflected that it was very late,
and that her Collect and Lord&#8217;s Prayer
would be sufficient. Youth has such confidence
in the sympathy of God. She
dropped softly on her knees and said her
portion. God would understand the rest.
The little ceremony soothed her, as a
mother&#8217;s kiss might have done; and with
a happy sigh she put out the light. The
old house was dark and still, but her
guardian angel saw her small hands loose
lying on the snowy linen, and heard her
whisper, &#8220;Dear God! how happy I am!&#8221;
And this joyous orison was the acceptable
prayer that left the smile of peace upon
her sleeping face.</p>
<p>In the guest-chamber Ulfar Fenwick
was also holding a session with himself.
He had come to his room very wide
awake; midnight was an early hour to
him. And the incidents he had been telling
filled his mind with images of the past.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
He could not at once put them aside.
Women he had loved and left visited his
memory,&mdash;light loves of a season, in which
both had declared themselves broken-hearted
at parting, and both had known
that they would very soon forget. Neither
was much to blame: the maid had long
ceased to remember his vows and kisses;
he, in some cases, had forgotten her name.
Yet, sitting there by the glowing oak logs,
he had visions of fair faces in all kinds of
surroundings,&mdash;in lighted halls, in moon-lit
groves under the great stars of the
tropics, on the Shetland seas when the
aurora made for lovers an enchanted atmosphere
and a light in which beauty was
glorified. Well, they had passed as April
passes, and now,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>As a glimpse of a burnt-out ember</p>
<p class='indent2'>Recalls a regret of the sun,</p>
<p>He remembered, forgot, and remembered</p>
<p class='indent2'>What love saw done and undone.</p>

<p>Aspatria was different from all. He
whispered her strange name on his lips,
and he thought it must have wandered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
from some sunny southern clime into these
northern solitudes. His eyes shone; his
heart beat. He said to it: &#8220;Make room
for this innocent little one! What a darling
she is! How clear, how candid, how
beautiful! Oh, to be loved by such a
woman! Oh, to kiss her!&mdash;to feel her
kiss me!&#8221; He set his mouth tightly; the
soft dreamy look in his face changed to
one of purpose and pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall win her, or die for it,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;By Saint George! I would rather die than
know that any other man had married her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the thought of marriage somewhat
sobered him. &#8220;I should have to give up
my voyage to the Spanish Colonies,&mdash;and
I am very much interested in their struggle.
I could not take her to Mexico, I suppose,&mdash;there
is nothing but fighting there;
and I could not&mdash;no, I could not leave
her. If she were mine, I should hate to
have any one else breathe the same air with
her. I could not endure that others should
speak to her. I should want to strike any
man who touched her hand. Perhaps I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
had better go away in the morning, and
ride this road no more. I have made my
plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>And fate had made other plans. Who
can fight against his destiny? When he
saw Aspatria in the morning, every plan
that did not include her seemed unworthy
of his consideration. She was ten times
lovelier in the daylight. She had that
fresh invincible charm which women of
culture and intellect seldom have: she
was inspired by her heart. It taught her
a thousand delightful subjugating ways.
She served his breakfast with her own fair
hands; she offered him the first sweet
flowers in the garden; she fluttered around
his necessities, his desires, his intentions,
with a grace and a kindness nothing but
love could have taught her.</p>
<p>He thanked her with marvellous glances,
with smiles, with single words dropped
only for her ears, with all the potent eloquence
which passion and experience
teach. And he had to pay the price, as
all men must do. The lesson he taught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
he also learned. &#8220;Aspatria!&#8221; he
said, in soft, penetrating accents;
and when she answered his
call and
came to his side,
her dress trailing
across his feet bewitched
him. They
were in the garden,
and he clasped her
hand, and went down
the budding alleys
with her, speechless, but gazing
into her face until she dropped
her tremulous, transparent lids before
her eyes; they were too full of
light and love to show to any mortal.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>The sky was</span> white and blue, the air
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
fresh and sweet; the swallows had just
come, and were chattering with the starlings;
hundreds of daffodils &#8220;danced in
the wind&#8221; and lighted the ground at their
feet; troops of celandines starred the
brook that babbled by the bee-skips; the
southernwood, the wall-flower, the budding
thyme and sweet-brier,&mdash;a thousand exhalations
filled the air and intensified that
intoxication of heart and senses which
makes the first stage of love&#8217;s fever
delirious.</p>
<p>Fenwick went away in the afternoon,
and his adieus were mostly made to the
Squire. He had done his best to win his
favour, and he had been successful. He
left Seat-Ambar under an engagement to
return soon and try his skill in wrestling
and pole-leaping with Brune. Aspatria
knew he would return: a voice which
Fenwick&#8217;s voice only echoed told her so.
She watched him from her own window
across the meadows, and up the mountain,
until he was lost to her vision.</p>
<p>She was doubtless very much in love,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
though as yet she had not admitted the
fact to herself. The experience had come
with a really shocking swiftness. Her
heart was half angry and half abashed by
its instantaneous surrender. Two circumstances
had promoted this condition.
First, the singular charm of the man.
Ulfar Fenwick was unlike any one she had
ever seen. The squires and gentlemen
who came to Seat-Ambar were physically
the finest fellows in England, but noble
women look for something more than
mere bulk in a man. Sir Ulfar Fenwick
had this something more. Culture, travel,
great experience with women, had added to
his heroic form a charm flesh and sinew
alone could never compass. And if he had
lacked all other physical advantages, he
possessed eyes which had been filled to
the brim with experiences of every kind,&mdash;gray
eyes with pure, full lids thickly
fringed,&mdash;eyes always lustrous, sometimes
piercingly bright. Secondly, Aspatria had
no knowledge which helped her to ward
off attack or protract surrender. In a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
multitude of lovers
there is safety; but
Fenwick was Aspatria&#8217;s
first lover.</p>

<img src='images/img_0033.jpg' alt='' title='' width='431' height='464' />
<br />
</div>
<p>He rode hard, as
if he would ride from
fate. Perhaps he
hoped at this early
stage of feeling to do as he had often
done before,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>To love&mdash;and then ride away.</p>
</div></div>
<p>He had also a fresh, pressing anxiety to
see his sister, who was Lady of Redware
Manor. Seven years&mdash;and much besides
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
years&mdash;had passed since they met. She
was his only sister, and ten years his
senior. She loved him as mothers love,
unquestioningly, with miraculous excuses
for all his shortcomings. She had been
watching for his arrival many hours before
he appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ulfar! how welcome you are!&#8221; she
cried, with tears in her eyes and her voice.
&#8220;Oh, my dear! how happy I am to see
you once more!&#8221;</p>
<p>She might have been his only love, he
kissed and embraced and kissed her again
so fondly. Oh, wondrous tie of blood
and kinship! At that moment there really
seemed to Ulfar Fenwick no one in the
whole world half so dear as his sister
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>He told her he had lost his way in the
storm and been detained by Squire Anneys;
and she praised the Squire, and
said that she would evermore love him
for his kindness. &#8220;I met him once, at
the Election Ball in Kendal. He danced
with me; &#8216;we neighbour each other,&#8217; you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
see; and they are a grand old family, I
can tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a younger brother, called
Brune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sister also,&mdash;a child yet, but very
handsome. You ought to see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would like her. I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ulfar, there is a &#8216;thus far&#8217; in everything.
In your wooing and pursuing,
the line lies south of Seat-Ambar. To
wrong a woman of that house would be
wicked and dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I wrong her? I have no
intention to do so. I say she is a lovely
lady, a great beauty, worthy of honest
love and supreme devotion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a rant about love and beauty!
Nine tenths of the men who talk in this
way do but blaspheme Love by taking his
name in vain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, Elizabeth, it is marriage or
the Spanish colonies for me. It is Miss
Anneys, or Cuba, New Orleans, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Mexico. Santa Anna is a supreme villain;
I have a fancy to see such a specimen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are then between the devil and
the deep sea; and I should say that the
one-legged Spaniard was preferable to the
deep sea of matrimony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is so fair! She has a virgin timidity
that enchants me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will become matronly indecision, or
mental weakness of will. In the future it
will drive you frantic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her sweet sensibility&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will crystallize into passionate irritation
or callous opposition. These childlike,
tender, clinging maidens are often
capable of sudden and dangerous action.
Better go to Cuba, or even to Mexico,
Ulfar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose she has wealth. You will
admit that excellence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is co-heir with her brothers. She
may have two thousand pounds a year.
You cannot afford to marry a girl so
poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not yet come to regard a large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
sum of money as a kind of virtue, or the
want of it as a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your wife ought to represent you.
How can this country-girl help you in the
society to which you belong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Society! What is society? In its
elemental verity it means toil, weariness,
loss of rest and health, useless expense,
envy, disappointment, heart-burnings,&mdash;all
for the sake of exchanging entertainments
with A and B, C and D. It means
chaff instead of wheat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to be happy, Ulfar, put
this girl out of your mind. I am sure her
brothers will oppose your suit. They will
not let their sister leave Allerdale. No
Anneys has ever done so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have strengthened my fancy,
Elizabeth. There is a deal of happiness
in the idea of prevailing, of getting the
mastery, of putting hindrances out of
the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have given you good advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many &#8216;counsels of perfection&#8217;
nobody dreams of following. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
advise a man in love not to love, is one
of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Love!&#8221; she cried scornfully. &#8220;Before
you make such a fuss about the
Spanish Colonies and their new-found
freedom, free yourself, Ulfar! You have
been a slave to some woman all your life.
You are one of those men who are naturally
not their own property. A child can
turn you hither and thither; a simple
country girl can lead you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed softly, and murmured,&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />FORGIVE ME, CHRIST!</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The ultimatum reached by Fenwick in
the consideration of any subject was, to
please himself. In the case of Aspatria
Anneys he was particularly determined to
do so. It was in vain Lady Redware entreated
him to be rational. How could he
be rational? It was the preponderance of
the emotional over the rational in his
nature which imparted so strong a personality
to him. He grasped all circumstances
by feeling rather than by reason.</p>
<p>In a few days he was again at Seat-Ambar.
Aspatria drew him, as the candle
draws the moth which has once burned
its wings at it. And among the simple
Anneys folk he found a hearty welcome.
With Squire William he travelled the hills,
and counted the flocks, and speculated on
the value of the iron-ore cropping out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
the ground. With Brune he went line-fishing,
and in the wide barns tried his
skill in wrestling or pole-leaping or single-stick.
He tolerated the rusticity of
the life, for the charming moments he
found with Aspatria.</p>
<p>No one like Ulfar Fenwick had ever
visited Ambar-Side. To the young men,
who read nothing but the Gentleman&#8217;s
Magazine and the Whitehaven Herald,
and to Aspatria, who had but a volume
of the Ladies&#8217; Garden Manual, Notable
Things, her Bible and Common Prayer,
Fenwick was a book of travel, song, and
story, of strange adventures, of odd bits
of knowledge, and funny experiences.
Things old and new fell from his handsome
lips. Squire William and Brune
heard them with grave attention, with delight
and laughter; Aspatria with eyes full
of wonder and admiration.</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:340px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_8' id='linki_8'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0041.jpg' alt='' title='' width='340' height='446' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>As the season</span> advanced and they grew
more familiar, Aspatria was thrown naturally
into his society. The Squire was in
the hay-field; Brune had his task there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
also. Or they were down at the Long
Pool, washing the sheep, or on the fells,
shearing them. In the haymaking, Aspatria
and
Fenwick made
some pretence of
assistance; but they both
very soon wearied of the real
labour. Aspatria would toss a few
furrows of the warm, sweet grass;
but it was much sweeter to sit down
under the oak-tree with Fenwick at her
side, and watch the moving picture, and
listen to the women singing in their
high shrill voices, as they turned the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
swaths, the Song of the Mower, and the
men mournfully shouting out the chorus
to it,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;We be all like grass! We be all like grass!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>As for the oak, it liked them to sit under
it; all its leaves talked to each other about
them. The starlings, though they are
always in a hurry, stopped to look at the
lovers, and went off with a Q-q-q of satisfaction.
The crows, who are a bad lot,
croaked innuendoes, and said it was to be
hoped that evil would not come of such
folly. But Aspatria and Fenwick listened
only to each other; they saw the whole
round world in each other&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Fenwick spoke very low; Aspatria had
to droop her ear to his mouth to understand
his words. And they were such
delightful words, she could not bear to
lose one of them. Then, as the sun grew
warm, and the scent of the grass filled the
soft air, and the haymakers were more and
more subdued and quiet, heavenly languors
stole over them. They sat hand in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
hand,&mdash;Aspatria sometimes with shut eyes
humming to herself, sometimes dreamily
pulling the long grass at her side; Fenwick
mostly silent, yet often whispering
those words which are single because they
are too sweet to be double,&mdash;&#8220;Darling!
Dearest! Angel!&#8221; and the words drew
her eyes to his eyes, drew her lips to his
lips; ere she was aware, her heart had
passed from her in long, loving, stolen
kisses. On the fells, in the garden, in
the empty, silent rooms of the old house,
it was a repetition of the same divine
song, with wondrously celestial variations.
Goethe puts in Faust an Interlude in
Heaven: Fenwick and Aspatria were in
their Interlude.</p>
<p>One evening they stood among the
wheat-sheaves. The round, yellow harvest-moon
was just rising above the fells,
and the stars trembling into vision. The
reapers had gone away; their voices made
faint, fitful echoes down the misty lane.
The Squire was driving home one load of
ripe wheat, and Brune another. Aspatria
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
said softly, &#8220;The day is over. We must
go home. Come!&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood in the warm mystical light,
with one hand upon the bound sheaf, the
other stretched out to him. Her slim
form in its white dress, her upturned face,
her star-like eyes,&mdash;he saw all at a glance.
He was subjugated to the innermost room
of his heart. He answered, with inexpressible
emotion,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come! Come to me, my Dear One!
My Love! My Joy! My Wife!&#8221; He
held her close to his heart; he claimed
her by no formal special yes, but by all
the sweet reluctances and sweeter yieldings,
the thousand nameless consents won
day by day.</p>

<p>Oh, the glory of that homeward walk!
The moon beamed upon them. The trees
bent down to touch them. The heath
and the honeysuckle made a posy for
them. The nightingale sang them a canticle.
They did not seem to walk; they
trod on ether; they moved as people
move in happy dreams of other stars,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
where thought and wish are motion. It
would have been heaven upon earth if
those minutes could have lasted; but it
was only an interlude.</p>
<p>That night Fenwick spoke to Squire
William and asked him for his sister. The
Squire was honestly confounded by the
question. Aspatria was such a little lass!
It was beyond everything to talk of marrying
her. Still, in his heart he was proud
and pleased at such high fortune for the
little lass; and he said, as soon as Fenwick&#8217;s
father and family came forward as
they should do, he would never be the one
to say nay.</p>
<p>Fenwick&#8217;s father lived at Fenwick Castle,
on the shore of bleak Northumberland.
He was an old man, but his natural
feelings and wisdom were not abated. He
consulted the History of Cumberland, and
found that the family of Ambar-Anneys
was as ancient and honourable as his own.
But the girl was country-bred, and her
fortune was small, and in a measure dependent
upon her brother&#8217;s management
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
of the estate. A careless
master of Ambar-Side
would make Aspatria
poor. While
he was considering
these
things, Lady
Redware arrived
at the
castle, and they talked
over the matter together.</p>

<img src='images/img_0047.jpg' alt='' title='' width='338' height='600' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;I expected Ulfar</span> to marry very
differently, and I must say I am disappointed.
But I suppose it will be useless
to make any opposition, Elizabeth,&#8221; the
old man said to his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite useless, father. But absence
works miracles. Try to secure
twelve months. You ought
to go to a warm climate
this winter; ask Ulfar
to take you to Italy.
In a year time may
re-shuffle the cards.
And you must write to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
girl, and to her eldest brother, who is a
fine fellow and as proud as Lucifer. I
called upon them before I left Cumberland.
She is very handsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Handsome! Old men know, Elizabeth,
that six months after a man is married,
it makes little difference to him
whether his wife is handsome or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be, or it may not be, father.
The thing to consider is, that young men
unfortunately persist in marrying for that
first six months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, fortune pilots many a ship
not steered. Suppose we leave things to
circumstances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! Human affairs are for the
most part arranged in such a way that
those turn out best to which most care
is devoted.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the letters were thoughtfully written;
the one to Aspatria being of a paternal
character, that to her brother polite and
complimentary. To his son Ulfar the old
baronet made a very clever appeal. He
reminded him of his great age, and of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
few opportunities left for showing his affection
and obedience. He regretted the
necessity for a residence in Italy during
the winter, but trusted to his son&#8217;s love to
see him through the experience. He congratulated
Ulfar on winning the love of a
young girl so fresh and unspoiled by the
world, but kindly insisted upon the wisdom
of a little delay, and the great benefit this
delay would be to himself.</p>
<p>It was altogether a very temperate, wise
letter, appealing to the best side of Ulfar&#8217;s
nature. Squire William read it also, and
gave it his most emphatic approval. He
was in no hurry to lose his little sister.
She was but a child yet, and knew nothing
of the world she was going into; and
&#8220;surely to goodness,&#8221; he said, looking at
the child, &#8220;she will have a lot of things
to look after, before she can think of
wedding.&#8221;</p>
<p>This last conjecture touched Aspatria
on a very womanly point. Of course there
were all her &#8220;things&#8221; to get ready. She
had never possessed more than a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
frocks at a time, and those of the simplest
character; but she was quite alive to the
necessity of an elaborate wardrobe, and
she had also an instinctive sense of what
would be proper for her position.</p>
<p>So the suggestions of Ulfar&#8217;s father were
accepted in their entirety, and the old
gentleman was put into a very good temper
by the fact. And what was a year?
&#8220;It will pass like a dream,&#8221; said Ulfar.
&#8220;And I shall write constantly to you, and
you will write to me; and when we meet
again it will be to part no more.&#8221; Oh,
the poverty of words in such straits as
these! Men say the same things in the
same extremities now that have been said
millions of times before them. And Aspatria
felt as if there ought to have been
entirely new words, to express the joy of
their betrothal and the sorrow of their
parting.</p>
<p>The short delay of a last week together
was perhaps a mistake. A very young
girl, to whom great joy and great sorrow
are alike fresh experiences, may afford a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
prolonged luxury of the emotions of parting.
Love, more worldly-wise, deprecates
its demonstrativeness, and would avert it
altogether. The farewell walks, the sentimental
souvenirs, the pretty and petty devices
of love&#8217;s first dream, are tiresome to
more practised lovers; and Ulfar had often
proved what very cobwebs they were to
bind a straying fancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absence makes the heart grow fonder.&#8221;
Perhaps so, if the last memory be an altogether
charming one. It was, unfortunately,
not so in Aspatria&#8217;s case. It should
have been a closely personal farewell with
Ulfar alone; but Squire Anneys, in his
hospitable ignorance, gave it a public character.
Several neighbouring squires and
dames came to breakfast. There was cup-drinking,
and toasting, and speech-making;
and Ulfar&#8217;s last glimpse of his betrothed
was of her standing in the wide porch, surrounded
by a waving, jubilant crowd of
strangers, whose intermeddling in his joy
he deeply resented. Anneys had invited
them in accord with the traditions of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
house and order. Fenwick thought it was
a device to make stronger his engagement
to Aspatria.</p>
<p>&#8220;As if it needed such contrivances!&#8221;
he muttered angrily. &#8220;When it does, it is
a broken thread, and no Anneys can knot
it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The weeks that followed were full of
new interests to Aspatria. Mistress Frostham,
the wife of a near shepherd-lord, had
been the friend of Aspatria&#8217;s mother; she
was fairly conversant with the world outside
the fells and dales, and she took the
girl under her care, accompanied her to
Whitehaven, and directed her in the purchase
of all considered necessary for the
wife of Ulfar Fenwick.</p>
<p>Then the deep snows shut in Seat-Ambar,
and the great white hills stood
round about it like fortifications. But as
often as it was possible the Dalton postman
fought his way up there, with his
packet of accumulated mail; for he knew
that a warm welcome and a large reward
awaited him. In the main, the long same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
days went happily by. William and Brune
had a score of resources for the season;
the farm-servants worked in the
barn; they were making and mending
sacks for the wheat, and caps
for the sheeps&#8217; heads
in fly-time,
sharpening
scythes and
tools, doing the indoor
work of a
great farm, and
mostly singing as they
did it.</p>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>As Aspatria sat</span> in her room,
surrounded by fine cambric and
linen and that exquisite English
thread-lace now gone out of fashion, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
could hear their laughter and their song,
and she unconsciously set her stitches to
its march and melody. The days were
not long to her. So many dozens of garments
to make with her own slight fingers!
She had not a moment to waste,
but the necessity was one of the sweetest
delight. The solitude and secrecy of her
labour added to its charm. She never
took her sewing into the parlour. And yet
she might have done so: William and
Brune had a delicacy of affection for her
which would have made them blind to her
occupation and densely stupid as to its
design.</p>
<p>So, although the days were mostly alike,
they were not unhappily so; and at intervals
destiny sent her the surprises she
loved. One morning in the beginning of
February, Aspatria felt that the postman
ought to come; her heart presaged him.
The day was clear and warm,&mdash;so much
so, that the men working in the barn had
all the windows open. They were singing
in rousing tones the famous North Country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
song to the barley-mow, and drinking it
through all its verses, out of the jolly
brown bowl, the nipperkin, the quarter-pint,
the quart and the pottle,&mdash;the gallon
and the anker,&mdash;the hogshead and the
pipe,&mdash;the well, and the river, and the
ocean,&mdash;and then rolling back the chorus,
from ocean to the jolly brown bowl. Suddenly,
while a dozen men were shouting in
unison,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a health to the barley mow!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>the verse was broken by the cry of &#8220;Here
comes Ringham the postman!&#8221; Then
Aspatria ran to the window and saw him
climbing the fell. She did not like to go
downstairs until Will called her; but she
could not sew another stitch. And when
at last the aching silence in her ears was
filled by Will&#8217;s joyful &#8220;Come here, Aspatria!
Here is such a parcel as never
was,&mdash;from foreign parts too!&#8221; she hardly
knew how her feet twinkled down the long
corridor and stairs.</p>
<p>The parcel was from Rome. Ulfar had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
sent it to his London banker, and the
banker had sent a special messenger to
Dalton with it. Over the fells at that season
no one but Ringham could have found
a safe way; and Ringham was made so
welcome that he was quite imperious. He
ordered himself a rasher of bacon, and a
bowl of the famous barley broth, and
spread himself comfortably before the
great hearth-place. At the table stood
Aspatria, William, and Brune. Aspatria
was nervously trying to undo the seals and
cords that bound love&#8217;s message to her.
Will finally took his pocket-knife and cut
them. There was a long letter, and a box
containing exquisite ornaments of Roman
cameos,&mdash;precious onyx, made more
precious by work of rare artistic beauty, a
comb for her dark hair, a necklace for her
white throat, bracelets for her slender
wrists, a girdle of stones linked with gold
for her waist. Oh, how full of simple delight
she was! She was too happy to
speak. Then Will discovered a smaller
package. It was for himself and Brune.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
Will&#8217;s present was a cameo ring, on which
were engraved the Anneys and Fenwick
arms. Brune had a scarf-pin, representing
a lovely Hebe. It was a great day at
Seat-Ambar. Aspatria could work no
more; Will and Brune felt it impossible
to finish the game they had begun.</p>
<p>There is a tide in everything: this was
the spring-tide of Aspatria&#8217;s love. In its
overflowing she was happy for many a
day after her brothers had begun to speculate
and wonder why Ringham did not
come. Suddenly it struck her that the
snow was gone, and the road open, and
that there was no letter. She began to
worry, and Will quietly rode over to Dalton,
to ask if any letter was lying there.
He came back empty-handed, silent, and
a little surly. The anniversary of their
meeting was at hand: surely Ulfar would
remember it, so Aspatria thought, and she
watched from dawn to dark, but no token
of remembrance came. The flowers began
to bloom, the birds to sing, the May sunshine
flooded the earth with glory, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
fear and doubt and dismay and daily disappointment
made deepest, darkest winter
in the low, long room where Aspatria
watched and waited. Her sewing had
been thrown aside. The half-finished garments,
neatly folded, lay under a cover
she had no strength to remove.</p>
<p>In June she wrote a pitiful little note to
her lover. She said that he ought to tell
her, if he was tired of their engagement.
She told Will what she had said, and asked
him to post the letter. He answered
angrily, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you write a word to him,
good or bad!&#8221; And he tore the letter
into twenty pieces before her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Will, I cannot bear it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art a woman: bear what other
women have tholed before thee.&#8221; Then
he went angrily from her presence. Brune
was thrumming on the window-pane. She
thought he looked sorry for her; she
touched his arm and said, &#8220;Brune, will
you take a letter to Dalton post for
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For sure I will. Go thy ways and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
write it, and I&#8217;ll be gone before Will is
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an unfortunate letter, as letters
written in a hurry always are. Absolute
silence would have piqued and worried
Ulfar. He would have fancied her ill,
dying perhaps; and the uncertainty, vague
and portentous, would have prompted him
to action, if only to satisfy his own mind.
Sometimes he feared that a girl so sensitive
would fade away in neglect; and he
expected a letter from William Anneys
saying so. But a hurried, halting, not
very correct epistle, whose whole tenour
was, &#8220;What is the matter? What have I
done? Do you remember last year at
this time?&#8221; irritated him beyond reply.</p>
<p>He was still in Italy when it reached
him. Sir Thomas Fenwick was not likely
ever to return to England. He was slowly
dying, and he had been removed to a villa
in the Italian hills. And Elizabeth Redware
had a friend with her, a young widow
just come from Athens, who affected at
times its splendid picturesque national
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
costume. She was a very bright, handsome
woman, whose fine education had
been supplemented by travel, society, and
a rather unhappy matrimonial experience.
She knew how to pique and provoke, how
to flirt to the very edge of danger and
then sheer off, how to manipulate men
before the fire of passion, as witches used
to manipulate their waxen images before
the blazing coals.</p>
<p>She had easily won Ulfar&#8217;s confidence;
she had even assisted in the selection of
the cameos; and she declared to Elizabeth
that she would not for a whole world
interfere between Ulfar and his pretty
innocent! A natural woman was such a
phenomenon! She was glad Ulfar was
going to marry a phenomenon.</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:293px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_12' id='linki_12'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0061.jpg' alt='' title='' width='293' height='373' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>Elizabeth knew</span> her better. She gave
the couple opportunity, and they needed
nothing more. There were already between
them a good understanding, transparent
secrets, little jokes, a confessed confidence.
They quickly became affectionate.
The lovely Sarah, relict of Herbert Sandys,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Esq., not only reminded Ulfar of his vows
to Aspatria, but in the very reminder she
tempted him to break them. When Aspatria&#8217;s
letter was put into his hand, she
was with him, marvellously arrayed in
tissue of silver and brilliant colours. A
head-dress of gold coins glittered in her
fair braided hair; her long white arms
were shining with bracelets; she was at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
once languid and impulsive, provoking
Elizabeth and Ulfar to conversation, and
then amazing them by the audacity and
contradiction of her opinions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so fortunate,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that Ulfar
has found a little out-of-the-way girl to appreciate
his great beauty. The world at
present does not think much of masculine
beauty. A handsome fellow who starts for
any of its prizes is judged to be frivolous
and poetical, perhaps immoral: you see
Byron&#8217;s beauty made him unfit for a legislator,
he could do nothing but write poetry.
I should say it was Ulfar&#8217;s best card to
marry this innocent with the queer name:
with his face and figure, he will never get
into Parliament. No one would trust him
with taxes. He is born to make love, and
he and his country Phyllis can go simpering
and kissing through life together. If
I were interested in Ulfar&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are interested in Ulfar, Sarah,&#8221;
interrupted Elizabeth. &#8220;You said so to
me last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I? Nevertheless, life does not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
give us time really to question ourselves,
and it is the infirmity of my nature to mistake
feeling for evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not change your opinions
so quickly, Sarah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is often an element of success to
change your opinions. It is hesitating
among a variety of views that is fatal.
The man who does not know what he
wants is the man who is held cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I know what I want, Sarah.&#8221;
And as he spoke, Ulfar looked with intelligence
at the fair widow, and in answer she
shot from her bright blue eyes a bolt of
summer lightning that set aflame at once
the emotional side of Ulfar&#8217;s nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say strange things, Sarah. I wish
it was possible to understand you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who shall read the interpretation
thereof?&#8217; is written on everything we see,
especially on women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; said Elizabeth, &#8220;that Ulfar
has quarrelled with his country maid. Is
there a quarrel, Ulfar, really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, with some temper.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>Sarah nodded at Ulfar, and said softly:
&#8220;The absent must be satisfied with the
second place. However, if you have quarrelled
with her, Ulfar, turn over a new
leaf. I found that out when poor Sandys
was alive. People who have to live together
must blot a leaf now and then with
their little tempers. The only thing is to
turn over a new one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything unpleasant happens to
me,&#8221; said Ulfar, &#8220;I try to bury it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot do it. The past is a ghost
not to be laid; and a past which is buried
alive, it is terrible.&#8221; It was Sarah who
spoke, and with a sombre earnestness not
in keeping with her usual character. There
was a minute&#8217;s pregnant silence, and it was
broken by the entrance of a servant with
a letter. He gave it to Ulfar.</p>
<p>It was Aspatria&#8217;s sorrowful, questioning
note. Written while Brune waited, it was
badly written, incorrectly constructed and
spelled, and generally untidy. It had the
same effect upon Ulfar that a badly
dressed, untidy woman would have had.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
He was ashamed of the irregular, childish
scrawl. He did not take the trouble to
put himself in the atmosphere in which
the anxious, sorrowful words had been
written. He crushed the paper in his
hand with much the same contemptuous
temper with which Elizabeth had seen him
treat a dunning letter. She knew, however,
that this letter was from Aspatria,
and, saying something about her father,
she went into an adjoining room, and left
Ulfar and Sarah together. She thought
Sarah would be the proper alterative.</p>
<p>The first words Sir Thomas Fenwick
uttered regarded Aspatria. Turning his
head feebly, he asked: &#8220;Has Ulfar quarrelled
with Miss Anneys? I hear nothing
of her lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he is tired of his fancy for her.
There is no quarrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was a good girl,&mdash;eh? Kindhearted,
beautiful,&mdash;eh, Elizabeth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She certainly was.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said no more then; but at midnight,
when Ulfar was sitting beside him, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
called his son, and spoke to him on the
subject. &#8220;I am going&mdash;almost gone&mdash;the
way of all flesh, Ulfar. Take heed of
my last words. You promised to make
Miss Anneys your wife,&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not break your promise. If she
gives it back to you, that might be well;
but you cannot escape from your own
word and deed. Honour keeps the door of
the house of life. To break your word is
to set the door wide open,&mdash;open for
sorrow and evil of all kinds. Take care,
Ulfar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day he died, and one of Ulfar&#8217;s
first thoughts was that the death set him
free from his promise for one year at the
least. A year contained a multitude of
chances. He could afford to write to
Aspatria under such circumstances. So
he answered her letter at once, and it
seemed proper to be affectionate, preparatory
to reminding her that their marriage
was impossible until the mourning for Sir
Thomas was over. Also death had softened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
his heart, and his father&#8217;s last words
had made him indeterminate and a little
superstitious. A clever woman of the
world would not have believed in this
letter; its <i>aura</i>&mdash;subtle but persistent, as
the perfume of the paper&mdash;would have
made her doubt its fondest lines. But
Aspatria had no idea other than that certain
words represented absolutely certain
feelings.</p>
<p>The letter made her joyful. It brought
back the roses to her cheeks, the spring
of motion to her steps. She began to
work in her room once more. Now and
then her brothers heard her singing the
old song she had sung so constantly with
Ulfar,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;A shepherd in a shade his plaining made,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Of love, and lovers&#8217; wrong,</p>
<p>Unto the fairest lass that trod on grass,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And thus began his song:</p>
<p>&#8216;Restore, restore my heart again,</p>
<p>Which thy sweet looks have slain,</p>
<p>Lest that, enforced by your disdain, I sing,</p>
<p>Fye! fye on love! It is a foolish thing!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Since love and fortune will, I honour still</p>
<p class='indent2'>Your dark and shining eye;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>What conquest will it be, sweet nymph, to thee,</p>
<p class='indent2'>If I for sorrow die?</p>
<p>Restore, restore my heart again,</p>
<p>Which thy sweet looks have slain,</p>
<p>Lest that, enforced by your disdain, I sing,</p>
<p>Fye! fye on love! It is a foolish thing!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>But the lifting of the sorrow was only
that it might press more heavily. No
more letters came; no message of any
kind; none of the pretty love-gages he
delighted in giving during the first months
of their acquaintance. A gloom more
wretched than that of death or sickness
settled in the old rooms of Seat-Ambar.
William and Brune carried its shadow on
their broad, rosy faces into the hay-fields
and the wheat-fields. It darkened all the
summer days, and dulled all the usual
mirth-making of the ingathering feasts.
William was cross and taciturn. He loved
his sister with all his heart, but he did not
know how to sympathize with her. Even
mother-love, when in great anxiety, sometimes
wraps itself in this unreasonable
irritability. Brune understood better. He
had suffered from a love-change himself;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
he knew its ache and longing, its black
despairs and still more cruel hopes. He
was always on the lookout for Aspatria;
and one day he heard news which he
thought would
interest her. Lady Redware
was at the Hall. William
had heard it a week before, but
he had not considered it prudent to
name the fact. Brune had a kinder
intelligence.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_13' id='linki_13'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0069.jpg' alt='' title='' width='465' height='351' />
<br />
</div>
<p>&#8220;Aspatria,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Redware Hall is
open again. I saw Lady Redware in the
village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brune! Oh, Brune, is he there too?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, he isn&#8217;t. I made sure of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brune, I want to go to Redware.
Perhaps his sister may tell me the truth.
Go with me. Oh, Brune, go with me! I
am dying of suspense and uncertainty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, they&#8217;re fit to kill anybody, let
alone a little lass like you. It will put
William about, and it may make bad
bread between us; but I&#8217;ll go with you,
even if we do have a falling out. I&#8217;m not
flayed for William&#8217;s rages.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next market-day Brune kept his
word. As soon as Squire Anneys had
climbed the fell breast and passed over
the brow of the hill, Brune was at the door
with horses for Aspatria and himself. She
was a good rider, and they made the distance,
in spite of hills and hollows, in two
hours. Lady Redware was troubled at the
visit, but she came to the door to welcome
Aspatria, and she asked Brune with particular
warmth to come into the house with
his sister. Brune knew better; he was
sure in such a case that it would prove a
mere formal call, and that Aspatria would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
never have the courage to ask the questions
she wished to.</p>
<p>But Aspatria had come to that point of
mental suffering when she wanted to know
the truth, even though the truth was the
worst. Lady Redware saw the determination
on her face, and resolved to gratify it.
She was shocked at the change in Aspatria&#8217;s
appearance. Her beauty was, in a
measure, gone. Her eyes were hollow,
and the lids dark and swollen with weeping.
Her figure was more angular. The
dew of youth, the joy of youth, was over.
She drooped like a fading flower. If Ulfar
saw her in such condition he might pity,
but assuredly he would not admire her.</p>
<p>Lady Redware kissed the poor girl.
&#8220;Come in, my dear,&#8221; she said kindly.
&#8220;How ill you look! Here is wine: take
a drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ill. I even hope I am dying.
Life is so hard to bear. Ulfar has forgotten
me. I have vexed him, and cannot
find out in what way. If you would only
tell me!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You have not vexed him at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is tired, or he has seen a fresher
face. That is Ulfar&#8217;s great fault. He
loves too well, because he does not love
very long. Can you not forget him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have other lovers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I never had a lover until Ulfar
wooed me. I will have none after him.
I shall love him until I die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What folly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. I am only a foolish child.
If I had been wise and clever, he would
not have left me. It is my fault. Do you
believe he will ever come to Seat-Ambar
again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think he will. It is best to
tell you the truth. My dear, I am truly
sorry for you! Indeed I am, Aspatria!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl had covered her face with her
thin white hands. Her attitude was so
hopeless that it brought the tears to Lady
Redware&#8217;s eyes. Hoping to divert her
attention, she said,&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Who called you Aspatria?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my mother&#8217;s name. She was
born in Aspatria, and she loved the place
very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it, child? I never heard of
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not far away, on the sea-coast,&mdash;a
little town that brother Will says has been
asleep for centuries. Such a pretty place,
straggling up the hillside, and looking
over the sea. Mother was born there, and
she is buried there, in the churchyard.
It is such an old church, one thousand
years old! Mother said it was built by
Saint Kentigern. I went there to pray
last week, by mother&#8217;s grave. I thought
she might hear me, and help me to bear
the suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor child! It is shameful of
Ulfar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not to blame. Will told me that
it was a poor woman who couldn&#8217;t keep
what she had won.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very brutal in Will to say such
a thing.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He did not mean it unkindly. We are
plain-spoken people, Lady Redware. Tell
me, as plainly as Will would tell me, if
there is any hope for me. Does Ulfar love
me at all now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Now I will go.&#8221; She
put out her hands before her, as if she was
blind and had to feel her way; and in
answer to all Lady Redware&#8217;s entreaties to
remain, to rest, to eat something, she only
shook her head, and stumbled forward.
Brune saw her coming. He was standing
by the horses, but he left them, and went
to meet his sister. Her misery was so visible
that he put her in the saddle with fear.
But she gathered the reins silently, and
motioned him to proceed; and Aspatria&#8217;s
last sad smile haunted Lady Redware for
many a day. Long afterward she recalled
it with a sharp gasp of pity and annoyance.
It was such a proud, sorrowful farewell.</p>
<p>She reached home, but it took the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
remnant of her strength. She was carried
to her bed, and she remained there many
weeks. The hills were white with snow,
and the winter winds were sounding among
them like the chant of a high mass, when
she came down once more to the parlor.
Even then Will carried her like a baby in
his arms. He had carried her mother in
the same way, when she began to die; and
his heart trembled and smote him. He
was very tender with his little sister, but
tempests of rage tossed him to and fro
when he thought of Ulfar Fenwick.</p>
<p>And he was compelled lately to think of
him very often. All over the fell-side, all
through Allerdale, it had begun to be
whispered, &#8220;Aspatria Anneys has been
deserted by her lover.&#8221; How the fact had
become known it was difficult to discover:
it was as if it had flown from roof to roof
with the sparrows. Will could see it in the
faces of his neighbours, could hear it in
the tones of their speech, could feel it in
the clasp of their hands. And he thought
of these things, until he could not eat a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
meal or sleep an hour in peace. His
heart was on fire with suppressed rage.
He told Brune that all he wanted was to
lay Fenwick across his knees and break
his neck. And then he spread out his
mighty hands, and clasped and unclasped
them with a silent force that had terrible
anticipation in it. And he noticed that
after her illness his sister no longer wore
the circlet of diamonds which had been
her betrothal-ring. She had evidently
lost all hope. Then it was time for him
to interfere.</p>
<p>Aspatria feared it when he came to her
room one morning and kissed her and
bade her good-by. He said he was going
a bit off, and might be a week away,&mdash;happen
more. But she did not dare to
question him. Will at times had masterful
ways, which no one dared to question.</p>
<p>Brune knew where his brother was going.
The night before he had taken
Brune to the little room which was called
the Squire&#8217;s room. In it there was a
large oak chest, black with age and heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
with iron bars. It contained the
title-deeds, and many other
valuable papers. Will explained
these
and the other
business
of the farm
to Brune;
and Brune
did not need
to ask him
why. He was
well aware
what business
William Anneys
was bent on, before
Will said,&mdash;&#8220;I
am going to Fenwick
Castle, Brune. I am
going to make that measureless
villain marry Aspatria.&#8221;</p>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;Is it worth</span> while, Will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth while. He shall keep his
promise. If he does not, I will kill him,
or he must kill me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If he kills you, Will, he must then
fight me.&#8221; And Brune&#8217;s face grew red and
hot, and his eyes flashed angry fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is as it should be; only keep your
anger at interest until you have lads to
take your place. We mustn&#8217;t leave Ambar-Side
without an Anneys to heir it. I
fancy your wrath won&#8217;t get cold while it is
waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will get hotter and hotter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And whatever happens, don&#8217;t you be
saving of kind words to Aspatria. The
little lass has suffered more than a bit;
and she is that like mother! I couldn&#8217;t
bide, even if I was in my grave, to think
of her wanting kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning Will went away.
Brune would not talk to Aspatria about
the journey. This course was a mistake;
it would have done her good to talk continually
of it. As it was, she was left to
chew over and over the cud of her mournful
anticipations. She had no womanly
friend near her. Mrs. Frostham had drawn
back a little when people began to talk of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
&#8220;poor Miss Anneys.&#8221; She had daughters,
and she did not feel that her friendship for
the dead included the living, when the living
were unfortunate and had questionable
things said about them.</p>
<p>And the last bitter drop in Aspatria&#8217;s
cup full of sorrow was the hardness of her
heart toward Heaven. She could not
care about God; she thought God did not
care for her. She had tried to make herself
pray, even by going to her mother&#8217;s
grave, but she felt no spark of that hidden
fire which is the only acceptable prayer.
There was a Christ cut out of ivory, nailed
to a large ebony cross, in her room. It
had been taken from the grave of an old
abbot in Aspatria Church, and had been
in her mother&#8217;s family three hundred years.
It was a Christ that had been in the grave
and had come back to earth. Her mother&#8217;s
eyes had closed forever while fixed upon
it, and to Aspatria it had always been an
object of supreme reverence and love.
She was shocked to find herself unmoved
by its white pathos. Even at her best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
hours she could only stand with clasped
hands and streaming eyes before it, and
with sad imploration cry,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot pray! I cannot pray! Forgive
me, Christ!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />ONLY BROTHER WILL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>It was a dull raw day
in late autumn, especially
dull and raw near the
sea, where there was an
evil-looking sky to the
eastward. Ulfar
Fenwick stood at a
window in Castle Fenwick
which commanded
the black, white-frilled
surges. He was watching
anxiously the point
at which the pale gray wall
of fog was thickest, a
wall of inconceivable height,
resting on the sea, reaching to
the clouds, when suddenly there emerged
from it a beautifully built schooner-yacht.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
She cut her way through the mysterious
barrier as if she had been a knife, and came
forward with short, stubborn plunges.</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:326px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_15' id='linki_15'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0081.jpg' alt='' title='' width='326' height='600' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>All over the</span> North Sea there are desolate
places full of the cries of parting souls,
but nowhere more desolate spaces than
around Fenwick Castle; and as the winter
was approaching, Ulfar was anxious to
escape its loneliness. His yacht had been
taking in supplies; she was making for
the pier at the foot of Fenwick Cliff, and
he was dressed for the voyage and about
to start upon it. He was going to the
Mediterranean, to Civita Vecchia, and his
purpose was the filial one of bringing
home the remains of the late baronet. He
had promised faithfully to see them laid
with those of his fore-elders on the windy
Northumberland coast; and he felt that
this duty must be done, ere he could comfortably
travel the westward route he had
so long desired.</p>
<p>He was slowly buttoning his pilot-coat,
when he heard a heavy step upon the
flagged passage. Many such steps had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
been up and down it that hour, but none
with the same fateful sound. He turned
his face anxiously to the door, and as he
did so, it was flung open, as if by an angry
man, and William Anneys walked in,
frowning and handling his big walking-stick
with a subdued passion that filled
the room as if it had been suddenly
charged with electricity. The two men
looked steadily at each other, neither of
them flinching, neither of them betraying
by the movement of an eyelash the emotion
that sent the blood to their faces and the
wrath to their eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;William Anneys! What do you
want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to set your wedding-day.
It must not be later than the fifteenth of
this month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I refuse to do so? I am going
to Italy for my father&#8217;s body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not leave England until you
marry my sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I refuse to do so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will have to take your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
chances of life or death. You will give me
satisfaction first; and if you escape the
fate you well deserve, Brune may have
better fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Duelling is now murder, sir, unless we
pass over to France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not go to France. Wrestling is
not murder, and we both know there is a
&#8216;throw&#8217; to kill; and I will &#8216;throw&#8217; until I
do kill,&mdash;or am killed. There&#8217;s Brune
after me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have ceased to love your sister. I
dare say she has forgotten me. Why do
you insist on our marriage? Is it that she
may be Lady Fenwick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look you, sir! I care nothing for
lordships or ladyships; such things are
matterless to me. But your desertion has
set wicked suspicions loose about Miss
Anneys; and the woman they dare to
think her, you shall make your wife. By
God in heaven, I swear it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have said wrong of Miss Anneys!
Impossible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir! they have not said wrong.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
If any man in Allerdale had dared to say
wrong, I had torn his tongue from his
mouth before I came here; and as for the
women, they know well I would hold their
husbands or brothers or sons responsible
for every ill word they spoke. But they
think wrong, and they make me feel it
everywhere. They look it, they shy off
from Aspatria,&mdash;oh, you know well enough
the kind of thing going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wrong thought of Miss Anneys is
atrocious. The angels are not more pure.&#8221;
He said the words softly, as if to himself;
and William Anneys stood watching him
with an impatience that in a moment or
two found vent in an emphatic stamp with
his foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no time to waste, sir. Are
you afraid to sup the ill broth you have
brewed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you have no mind to marry.
Well, then, we will fight! I like that
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will fight both you and your brother,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
make any engagement you wish; but if the
fair name of Miss Anneys is in danger, I
have a prior engagement to marry her. I
will keep it first. Afterward I am at your
service, Squire, yours and your brother&#8217;s;
for I tell you plainly that I shall leave my
wife at the church door and never see her
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I care not how soon you leave her; the
sooner the better. Will the eleventh of
this month suit you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it the fifteenth. To what church
will you bring my fair bride?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your scoffing for a fitter time.
If you look in that way again, I will strike
the smile off your lips with a hand that
will leave you little smiling in the future.&#8221;
And he passed his walking-stick to his left,
and doubled his large right hand with an
ominous readiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may even quarrel like gentlemen,
Mr. Anneys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t you laugh like a blackguard,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer me civilly. At what church
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
shall I meet Miss Anneys, and at what
hour on the fifteenth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At Aspatria Church, at eleven o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aspatria?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, to be sure! There will be witnesses
there, I can tell you,&mdash;generations
of them, centuries of generations. They
will see that you do the right thing, or
they will dog your steps till you have paid
the uttermost farthing of the wrong. Mind
what you do, then!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dead frighten me no more than
the living do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find out, maybe, what the
vengeance of the dead is. I would be
willing to leave you to it, if you shab off,
and I am not sure but you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;William Anneys, you are sure I will
not. You are saying such things to provoke
me to a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What reason have I to be sure? All
the vows you made to Aspatria you have
counted as a fool&#8217;s babble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you my word of honour. Between
gentlemen that is enough.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, to be sure! Gentlemen
can make it enough. But a poor little lass,
what can she do but pine herself into a
grave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will listen to you no longer, Squire
Anneys. If your sister&#8217;s good name is at
stake, it is my first duty to shield it with
my own name. If that does not satisfy
your sense of honour, I will give you and
your brother whatever satisfaction you
desire. On the fifteenth of this month, at
eleven o&#8217;clock, I will meet you at Aspatria
Church. Where shall I find the place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not far from Gosforth and Dalton,
on the coast. You cannot miss it, unless
you never look for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you never look for it. I do not
feel to trust you. But this is a promise
made to a man, made to William Anneys;
and he will see that you keep it, or else
that you pay for the breaking of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Squire. There is no
necessity to prolong such an unpleasant
visit.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Nay, I will not &#8216;good-morning&#8217; with
you. I have not a good wish of any kind
for you.&#8221;</p>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>With these defiant</span> words he left the
castle, and Fenwick threw off his pilot-coat
and sat
down to consider.
First
thoughts generally
come
from the selfish,
and therefore
the worst, side
of any nature; and
Fenwick&#8217;s first thoughts
were that his yacht was ready to sail,
and that he could go away, and stay away
until Aspatria married, or some other
favourable change took place. He cared
little for England. With good management
he could bring home and bury his
father&#8217;s dust without the knowledge of
William Anneys. Then there was the
west! America was before him, north and
south. He had always promised himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
to see the whole western continent ere he
settled for life in England.</p>
<p>Such thoughts were naturally foremost,
but he did not encourage them. He felt
no lingering sentiment of pity or love for
Aspatria, but he realized very clearly what
suspicion, what the slant eye, the whispered
word, the scornful glance, the doubtful
shrug, meant in those primitive valleys.
And he had loved the girl dearly; he had
promised to marry her. If she wished him
to keep his promise, if it was a necessity to
her honour, then he would redeem with his
own honour his foolish words. He told
himself constantly that he had not a particle
of fear, that he despised Will and Brune
Anneys and their brutal vows of vengeance;
but&mdash;but perhaps they did unconsciously
influence him. Life was sweet
to Ulfar Fenwick, full of new dreams and
hopes set in all kinds of new surroundings.
For Aspatria Anneys why should he die?
It was better to marry her. The girl had
been sweet to him, very sweet! After all,
he was not sure but he preferred that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
should be so bound to him as to prevent
her marrying any other man. He still
liked her well enough to feel pleasure in
the thought that he had put her out of the
reach of any future lover she might have.</p>
<p>Squire Anneys rode home in what
Brune called &#8220;a pretty temper for any
man.&#8221; His horse was at the last point of
endurance when he reached Seat-Ambar,
he himself wet and muddy, &#8220;cross and
unreasonable beyond everything.&#8221; Aspatria
feared the very sound of his voice.
She fled to her room and bolted the door.
At that hour she felt as if death would be
the best thing for her; she had brought
only sorrow and trouble and apprehended
disgrace to all who loved her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think God has forgotten me too!&#8221;
she cried, glancing with eyes full of anguish
to the pale Crucified One hanging
alone and forsaken in the darkest corner
of the room. Only the white figure was
visible; the cross had become a part of
the shadows. She remembered the joyous,
innocent prayers that had been wont
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
to make peace in her heart and music on
her lips; and she looked with a sorrow
that was almost reproach at her Book of
Common Prayer, lying dusty and neglected
on its velvet cushion. In her rebellious,
hopeless grief, she had missed all its
wells of comfort. Oh, if an angel would
only open her eyes! One had come to
Hagar in the desert: Aspatria was almost
in equal despair.</p>
<p>Yet when she heard her brother Will&#8217;s
voice she knew not of any other sanctuary
than the little table which held her Bible
and Prayer Book, and upon which the wan,
sad ivory Christ looked down. In speechless
misery, with clasped hands and low-bowed
head, she knelt there. Will&#8217;s voice,
strenuous and stern, reached her at intervals.
She knew from the silence in the
kitchen and farm-offices, and the hasty
movements of the servants, that Will was
cross; and she greatly feared her eldest
brother when he was in what Brune called
one of his rages.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>

</div>
<img src='images/img_0093.jpg' alt='' title='' width='461' height='550' />
<br />
</div>
<p>A long lull was followed by a sharp call.
It was Will calling her name. She felt it
impossible to answer, impossible to move;
and as he ascended the stairs and came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
grumbling along the corridor, she crouched
lower and lower. He was at her door,
his hand on the latch; then a few piteous
words broke from her lips: &#8220;Help, Christ,
Saviour of the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly, like a flash of lightning, came
the answer, &#8220;It is I. Be not afraid.&#8221; She
said the words herself, gave to her heart
the promise and the comfort of it, and, so
saying them, she drew back the bolt and
stood facing her brother. He had a candle
in his hand, and it showed her his red,
angry face, and showed him the pale, resolute
countenance of a woman who had
prayed and been comforted.</p>
<p>He walked into the room and put the
candle down on a small table in its centre.
They both stood a moment by it; then
Aspatria lifted her face to her brother and
kissed him. He was taken aback and
softened, and troubled at his heart. Her
suffering was so evident; she was such a
gray shadow of her former self.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aspatria! Aspatria! my little lass!&#8221;
Then he stopped and looked at her again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Will? Dear Will, what is
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be married on the fifteenth.
Get something ready. I will see Mrs.
Frostham and ask her to help you a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom am I to marry, Will? On the
fifteenth? It is impossible! See how ill
I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to marry Ulfar Fenwick. Ill?
Of course you are ill; but you must go to
Aspatria Church on the fifteenth. Ulfar
Fenwick will meet you there. He will
make you his wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have forced him to marry me. I
will not go, I will not go. I will not
marry Ulfar Fenwick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall go, if I carry you in my
arms! You shall marry him, or I&mdash;will&mdash;kill&mdash;you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then kill me! Death does not terrify
me. Nothing can be more cruel hard than
the life I have lived for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her steadily, and she
returned the gaze. His face was like a
flame; hers was white as snow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There are things in life worse than
death, Aspatria. There is dishonour, disgrace,
shame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is sorrow dishonour? Is it a disgrace
to love? Is it a shame to weep when love
is dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, my little lass, it may be a great
wrong to love and to weep. There is a
shadow around you, Aspatria; if people
speak of you they drop their voices and
shake their heads; they wonder, and they
think evil. Your good name is being
smiled and shaken away, and I cannot
find any one, man or woman, to thrash
for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood listening to him with wide-open
eyes, and lips dropping a little apart,
every particle of colour fled from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is for this reason Fenwick is to
marry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forced him; I know you forced
him.&#8221; She seemed to drag the words
from her mouth; they almost shivered;
they broke in two as they fell halting on
the ear.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must say he did not need forcing,
when he heard your good name was
in danger. He said, manly enough, that
he would make it good with his own name.
I do not much think I could have either
frightened or flogged him into marrying
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Will! I cannot marry him in this
way! Let people say wicked things of
me, if they will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, I will not! I cannot help them
thinking evil; but they shall not look it,
and they shall not say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they do not even think it,
Will. How can you tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well enough, Aspatria. How many
women come to Ambar-Side now? If
you gave a dance next week, you could
not get a girl in Allerdale to accept your
invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the truth. You must stop all this
by marrying Ulfar Fenwick. He saw it
was only just and right: I will say that
much for him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Let me alone until morning. I will
do what you say.&mdash;Oh, mother! mother
I want mother now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor little lass! I am only brother
Will; but I am sorry for thee, I am that!&#8221;</p>

<p>She tottered to the
bedside, and he lifted her
gently, and laid her on it; and then, as
softly as if he was afraid of waking her, he
went out of the room. Outside the door
he found Brune. He had taken off his
shoes, and was in his stocking-feet. Will
grasped him by the shoulder and led him
to his own chamber.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What were you watching me for?
What were you listening to me for? I
have a mind to hit you, Brune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better not hit me, Will. I
was not bothering myself about you.
I was watching Aspatria. I was listening,
because I knew the madman in you had
got loose, and I was feared for my sister.
I was not going to let you say or do
things you would be sorry to death for
when you came to yourself. And so you
are going to let that villain marry Aspatria?
You are not of my mind, Will. I
would not let him put a foot into our
decent family, or have a claim of any kind
on our sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done what I thought best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say it is best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t ask for your opinion. Go
to your own room, Brune, and mind your
own affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Brune, brought up in the religious
belief of the natural supremacy of the
elder brother, went off without another
word, but with a heart full to overflowing
of turbulent, angry thoughts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>In the morning Will went to see Mrs.
Frostham. He told her of his interview
with Ulfar Fenwick, and begged her to
help Aspatria with such preparations as
could be made. But neither to her nor
yet to Aspatria did he speak of Fenwick&#8217;s
avowed intention to leave his wife after the
ceremony. In the first place, he did not
believe that Fenwick would dare to give
him such a cowardly insult; and then,
also, he thought that the sight of Aspatria&#8217;s
suffering would make him tender
toward her. William Anneys&#8217;s simple,
kindly soul did not understand that of all
things the painful results of our sins are
the most irritating. The hatred we ought
to give to the sin or to the sinner, we give
to the results.</p>
<p>Surely it was the saddest preparation
for a wedding that could be. Will and
Brune were &#8220;out.&#8221; They did not speak to
each other, except about the farm business.
Aspatria spent most of her time in her
own room with a sempstress, who was
making the long-delayed wedding-dress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
The silk for it had been bought more than
a year, and it had lost some of its lustrous
colour. Mrs. Frostham paid a short visit
every day, and occasionally Alice Frostham
came with her. She was a very
pretty girl, gentle and affectionate to Aspatria;
and just because of her kindness
Will determined at some time to make her
Mistress of Seat-Ambar.</p>
<p>But in the house there was a great depression,
a depression that no one could
avoid feeling. Will gave no orders for
wedding-festivities; a great dinner and
ball would have been a necessity under the
usual circumstances, but there were no
arrangements even for a breakfast. Aspatria
wondered at the omission, but she did
not dare to question Will; indeed. Will
appeared to avoid her as much as he
could.</p>
<p>Really, William Anneys was very anxious
and miserable. He had no dependence
upon Fenwick&#8217;s promise, and he
felt that if Fenwick deceived him there
was nothing possible but the last vengeance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
He had this thought constantly
in his mind; and he was
quietly ordering
things on the
farm for a long
absence, and for Brune&#8217;s
management
or succession.
He paid several
visits to Whitehaven,
where was his banker, and to
Gosport, where his lawyer
lived. He felt, during
that terrible interval
of suspense, very much as a man
under sentence of death
might feel.</p>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>The morning of</span> the
fifteenth broke chill and dark,
with a promise of rain. Great
Gable was carrying on a conflict
with an army of gray clouds
assailing his summit and boding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
no good for the weather. The fog
rolled and eddied from side to side of the
mountains, which projected their black
forms against a ghastly, neutral tint behind
them; and the air was full of that melancholy
stillness which so often pervades the
last days of autumn.</p>
<p>Squire Anneys had slept little for two
weeks, and he had been awake all the
night before. While yet very early, he
had every one in the house called. Still
there were no preparations for company
or feasting. Brune came down grumbling
at a breakfast by candle-light, and he and
William drank their coffee and made a
show of eating almost in silence. But
there was an unspeakable tenderness in
William&#8217;s heart, if he had known how to
express it. He looked at Brune with a
new speculation in his eyes. Brune might
soon be master of Ambar-Side: what
kind of a master would he make? Would
he be loving to Aspatria? When Brune
had sons to inherit the land, would he
remember his promise, and avenge the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
insult to the Anneys, if he, William, should
give his life in vain? Out of these questions
many others arose; but he was naturally
a man of few words, and not able to
talk himself into a conviction that he
was doing right; nor yet was he able to
give utterance to the vague objections
which, if defined by words, might perhaps
have changed his feelings and his
plans.</p>
<p>He had sent Aspatria word that she
must be ready by ten o&#8217;clock. At eight
she began to dress. Her sleep had been
broken and miserable. She looked anxiously
in the glass at her face. It was as
white as the silk robe she was to wear. A
feeling of dislike of the unhappy garment
rose in her heart. She had bought the
silk in the very noon of her love and
hopes, a shining piece of that pearl-like
tint which only the most brilliant freshness
and youth can becomingly wear. Many
little accessories were wanting. She tried
the Roman cameos with it, and they
looked heavy; she knew in her womanly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
heart that it needed the lustre of gems, the
sparkle of diamonds or rubies.</p>
<p>Mrs. Frostham came a little later, and
assisted her in her toilet; but a passing
thought of the four bridemaids she had
once chosen for this office made her eyes
dim, while the stillness of the house, the
utter neglect of all symbols of rejoicing,
gave an ominous and sorrowful atmosphere
to the bride-robing. Still, Aspatria looked
very handsome; for as the melancholy
toilet offices proceeded with so little interest
and so little sympathy, a sense of
resentment had gradually gathered in the
poor girl&#8217;s heart. It made her carry herself
proudly, it brought a flush to her
cheeks, and a flashing, trembling light to
her eyes which Mrs. Frostham could not
comfortably meet.</p>
<p>A few minutes before ten, she threw over
all her fateful finery a large white cloak,
which added a decided grace and dignity
to her appearance. It was a garment
Ulfar had sent her from London,&mdash;a long,
mantle-like wrap, made of white cashmere,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
and lined with quilted white satin. Long
cords and tassels of chenille fastened it at
the throat, and the hood was trimmed with
soft white fur. She drew the hood over
her head, she felt glad to hide the wreath
of orange-buds and roses which Mrs. Frostham
had insisted upon her wearing,&mdash;the
sign and symbol of her maidenhood.</p>
<p>Will looked at her with stern lips, but
as he wrapped up her satin-sandalled feet
in the carriage, he said softly to her, &#8220;God
bless you, Aspatria!&#8221; His voice trembled,
but not more than Aspatria&#8217;s as she
answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Will. You and Brune are
father and mother to me to-day. There
is no one else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, my little lass. We are
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was alone in the carriage. Will
and Brune rode on either side of her. The
Frosthams, the Dawsons, the Bellendens,
the Atkinsons, and the Lutons followed.
Will had invited every one to the church,
and curiosity brought those who were not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
moved by sympathy or regard.
Fortunately the rain held off,
though the air was damp and
exceedingly depressing.</p>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>When they</span> arrived
at Aspatria Church,
they found the yard full;
every gravestone was occupied
by a little party of
gossips. At the
gate there was
a handsome
travelling-chariot
with
four
horses.
It lifted
a great
weight of
apprehension from
William Anneys, for it
told him that Fenwick had
kept his word. He helped Aspatria
to alight, and his heart ached for her. How
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
would she be able to walk between that
crowd of gazing, curious men and women?
He held her arm tight against his big
heart, and Brune, carefully watching her,
followed close behind.</p>
<p>But Aspatria&#8217;s inner self had taken possession
of the outer woman. She walked
firmly and proudly, with an erect grace,
without hesitation and without hurry, toward
her fate. Something within her kept saying
words of love and encouragement; she
knew not what they were, only they
strengthened her like wine. She passed
the church door whispering the promise
given her,&mdash;&#8220;It is I. Be not afraid.&#8221;
And then her eyes fell upon the ancient
stone font, at which her father and mother
had named her. She put out her hand and
just touched its holy chalice.</p>
<p>The church was crowded with a curious
and not unsympathetic congregation. Aspatria
Anneys was their own, a dales-woman
by a thousand years of birthright.
Fenwick was a stranger. If he were going
to do her any wrong, and Will Anneys was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
ready to punish him for it, every man and
woman present would have stood shoulder
to shoulder with Will. There was an undefined
expectation of something unusual, of
something more than a wedding. This
feeling, though unexpressed, made itself
felt in a very pronounced way. Will and
Brune looked confidingly around; Aspatria
gathered courage with every step.
She felt that she was among her own
people, living and dead.</p>
<p>As soon as they really entered the
church, they saw Fenwick. He was with
an officer wearing the uniform of the
Household Troops; and he was evidently
pointing out to him the ancient tombs of
the Ambar-Anneys family, the Crusaders
in stone, with sheathed swords and hands
folded in prayer, and those of the family
abbots, adorned with richly floriated
crosses.</p>
<p>When he saw Aspatria he bowed, and
advanced rapidly to the altar. She had
loosened her cloak and flung back her
hood, and she watched his approach with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
eyes that seemed two separate souls of
love and sorrow. One glance from them
troubled him to the seat of life. He
motioned to the waiting clergyman, and
took his place beside his bride. There
was a dead stillness in the church, and a
dead stillness outside; the neighing of a
horse sounded sharp, imperative, fateful.
A ripple of a smile followed; it was a lucky
omen to hear a horse neigh. Brune
glanced at his sister, but she had not
heeded it. Her whole being was swallowed
up in the fact that she was standing
at Ulfar&#8217;s side, that she was going to be
his wife.</p>
<p>The aged clergyman was fumbling with
the Prayer Book: &#8220;The Form of Solemnization
of Matrimony&#8221; seemed hard to find.
And so vagrant is thought, that while he
turned the leaves Aspatria remembered the
travelling-chariot, and wondered whether
Ulfar meant to carry her away in it, and
what she would do for proper clothing.
Will ought to have told her something of
the future. How cruel every one had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
been! It took but a moment for these
and many other thoughts to invade Aspatria&#8217;s
heart, and spread dismay and anxiety
and again the sense of resentment.</p>
<p>Then she heard the clergyman begin.
His voice was like that of some one speaking
in a dream, till she sharply called herself
together, hearing also Ulfar&#8217;s voice,
and knowing that she too would be called
upon for her assent. She glanced up at
Ulfar, who was dressed with great care and
splendour and looking very handsome, and
said her &#8220;I will&#8221; with the glance. Ulfar
could not receive it unmoved; he looked
steadily at her, and then he saw the ruin
of youth that his faithlessness had made.
Remorse bit him like a serpent, but remorse
is not repentance. Then William
Anneys gave his sister to his enemy; and
the gift was like death to him, and the
look accompanying the gift filled Ulfar&#8217;s
heart with a contemptuous anger fatal to
all juster or kinder feelings.</p>
<p>When the service was ended, Fenwick
turned to Aspatria and offered her his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
hand. She put hers into his, and so he led
her down the aisle, and through the churchyard,
to her own carriage. William had
followed close. He wondered if Fenwick
meant to take his wife with him, and he
resolved to give him the opportunity to do
so. But as soon as he perceived that the
bridegroom would carry out his threat, and
desert his bride at the church gates, he
stepped forward and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is enough, Sir Ulfar Fenwick.
I have made you keep your word. I will
care for your wife. She shall neither bear
your name nor yet take anything from
your bounty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fenwick paid no heed to his brother-in-law.
He looked at Aspatria. She was
whiter than snow; she had the pallor of
death. He lifted his hat and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Farewell, Lady Fenwick. We shall
meet no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Ulfar,&#8221; she answered calmly, &#8220;it
is not my will that we met here to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And as for meeting no more,&#8221; said
Brune, with passionate contempt, &#8220;I will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
warrant that is not in your say-so, Ulfar
Fenwick.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Fenwick&#8217;s friend handed
Will Anneys a card; then they drove rapidly
away. Will was carefully wrapping
his sister for her solitary ride back to Seat-Ambar;
and he did this with forced deliberation,
trying to appear undisturbed by
what had occurred; for, since it had happened,
he wished his neighbours to think
he had fully expected it. And while so
engaged he found opportunity to whisper
to Aspatria: &#8220;Now, my little lass, bear up
as bravely as may be. It is only one hour.
Only one hour, dearie! Don&#8217;t you try to
speak. Only keep your head high till you
get home, darling!&#8221;</p>
<p>So the sad procession turned homeward,
Aspatria sitting alone in her carriage,
William and Brune riding on either side
of her, the squires and dames bidden to
the ceremony following slowly behind.
Some talked softly of the affair; some passionately
assailed William Anneys for not
felling the villain where he stood. Gradually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
they said good-by, and so went to their
own homes. Aspatria had to speak to
each, she had to sit erect, she had to bear
the wondering, curious gaze not only of
her friends, but of the hinds and peasant-women
in the small hamlets between the
church and Seat-Ambar; she had to endure
her own longing and disappointment,
and make a poor attempt to smile when
the children flung their little posies of late
flowers into the passing carriage.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</div>
<img src='images/img_0114.jpg' alt='' title='' width='455' height='300' />
<br />
</div>
<p>To the last moment she bore it. &#8220;A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
good, brave girl!&#8221; said Will, as he left her
at her own room door. &#8220;My word! it is
better to have good blood than good
fortune: good blood never was beat!
Aspatria is only a little lass, but she is
more than a match for yon villain! A big
villain he is, a villain with a latchet!&#8221;</p>
<p>The miserable are sacred. All through
that wretched afternoon no one troubled
Aspatria. Will and Brune sat by the
parlour fire, for the most part silent. The
rain, which had barely held off until their
return from the church, now beat against
the window-panes, and drenched and scattered
even the hardy Michaelmas daisies.
The house was as still as if there had been
death instead of marriage in it. Now and
then Brune spoke, and sometimes William
answered him, and sometimes he did not.</p>
<p>At last, after a long pause, Brune asked:
&#8220;What was it Fenwick&#8217;s friend gave you?
A message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A message.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might as well say what, Will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I might. It said Fenwick would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
wait for me a week at the Sceptre Inn,
Carlisle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you go to Carlisle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure I will go. I would not
miss the chance of &#8216;throwing&#8217; him,&mdash;no,
not for ten years&#8217; life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! what a lot of trouble has
come with just taking a stranger in out
of the storm!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, it is a venturesome thing to do.
How can any one tell what a stranger may
bring in with him?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />FOR MOTHER&#8217;S SAKE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>In the upper chamber where Will had
left his sister, a great mystery of sorrow
was being endured. Aspatria felt as if all
had been. Life had no more joy to give,
and no greater grief to inflict. She undressed
with rapid, trembling fingers; her
wedding finery was hateful in her sight.
On the night before she had folded all her
store of clothing, and laid it ready to put
in a trunk. She had been quite in the
dark as to her destiny; the only thing that
appeared certain to her was that she would
have to leave home. Perhaps she would
go with Ulfar from the church door. In
that case Will would have to send her
clothing, and she had laid it in the neatest
order for the emergency.</p>
<p>On the top of one pile lay a crimson
Canton crape shawl. Her mother had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
worn it constantly during the last year of
her life; and Aspatria had put it away, as
something too sacred for ordinary use.
She now folded it around her shoulders,
and sat down. Usually, when things troubled
her, she was restless and kept in
motion, but this trouble was too bitter and
too great to resist; she was quiet, she took
its blows passively, and they smote her on
every side.</p>
<p>Could she ever forget that cruel ride
home, ever cease to burn and shiver when
she remembered the eyes that had scanned
her during its progress? The air seemed
full of them. She covered her face to
avoid the pitying, wondering, scornful
glances. But this ride through the valley
of humiliation was not the bitterest drop
in her bitter cup; she could have smiled
as she rode and drank it, if Ulfar had been
at her side. It was his desertion that was
so distracting to her. She had thought
of many sorrows in connection with this
forced marriage, but this sorrow had never
suggested itself as possible.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>Therefore, when Ulfar bade her farewell
she had felt as if standing on the void of
the universe. It was the superhuman
woman within her that had answered him,
and that had held up her head and had
strengthened her for her part all through
that merciless ride. And the sight of her
handsome, faithless lover, the tones of his
voice, the touch of his hand, his half-respectful,
half-pitying kindness, had awakened
in her heart a tenfold love for him.</p>
<p>For she understood then, for the first
time, her social and educational inferiority.
She felt even that she had done herself
less than justice in her fine raiment: her
country breeding and simple beauty would
have appeared to greater advantage in the
white merino she had desired to wear.
She had been forced into a dress that
accentuated her deficiencies. At that
hour she thought she could never see
Mrs. Frostham again.</p>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>To these tempestuous,</span> humiliating, heart-breaking
reflections the storm outside
made an angry accompaniment. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
wind howled down the chimney and wailed
around the house, and the rain beat
against the window and pattered on the
flagged walks.
The darkness
came on early,
and the cold grew
every hour more
searching. She
was not insensible
to these
physical discomforts,
but
they seemed
so small a
part of her
misery that
she made no
resistance to
their attack.
Will and Brune,
sitting almost speechless
downstairs, were both thinking of her.
When it was quite dark they grew unhappy.
First one and then the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
crept softly to her room door. All was as
still as death. No movement, no sound of
any kind, betrayed in what way the poor
soul within suffered. No thread of light
came from beneath the door: she was in
the dark, and she had eaten nothing all day.</p>
<p>About six o&#8217;clock Will could bear it no
longer. He knocked softly at her door,
and said: &#8220;My little lass, speak to Will!
Have a cup of tea! Do have a cup of
tea, dearie!&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice was so unlike Will&#8217;s voice that
it startled Aspatria. It told her of a suffering
almost equalling her own. She
rose from the chair in which she had been
sitting for hours, and went to him. The
room was dark, the passage was dark; he
saw nothing but the denser dark of her
figure, and her white face above it. She
saw nothing but his great bulk and his
shining eyes. But she felt the love flowing
out from his heart to her, she felt his
sorrow and his sympathy, and it comforted
her. She said: &#8220;Will, do not fret about
me. I am over-getting the shame and sorrow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
Yes, I will have a cup of tea, and
tell Tabitha to make a fire here. Dear
Will, I have been a great care and shame
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, you have, Aspatria; but I would
rather die than miss you, my little lass.&#8221;</p>
<p>This interview gave a new bent to Aspatria&#8217;s
thoughts. As she drank the tea, and
warmed her chilled feet before the blaze,
she took into consideration what misery
her love for Ulfar Fenwick had brought to
her brothers&#8217; once happy home, the anxiety,
the annoyance, the shame, the ill-will
and quarrelling, the humiliations that Will
and Brune had been compelled to endure.
Then suddenly there flashed across her
mind the card given to Will by Ulfar&#8217;s
friend. She was not too simple to conceive
of its meaning. It was a defiance of
some kind, and she knew how Will would
answer it. Her heart stood still with
terror.</p>
<p>She had seen Will and Ulfar wrestling;
she had heard Will say to Brune, when
Ulfar was absent, &#8220;He knows little about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
it; when I had that last grip, I could have
flung him into eternity.&#8221; It was common
enough for dalesmen quarrelling to have
a &#8220;fling&#8221; with one another and stand by
its results. If Will and Ulfar met thus,
one or both would be irremediably injured.
In their relation to her, both were equally
dear. She would have given her poor
little life cheerfully for the love of either.
Her cup shook in her hand. She had a
sense of hurry in the matter, that drove
her like a leaf before a strong wind. If
Will got to bed before she saw him, he
might be away in the morning ere she was
aware. She put down her cup, and while
she stood a moment to collect her strength
and thoughts, the subject on all its sides
flashed clearly before her.</p>
<p>A minute afterward she opened the parlour
door. Brune sat bent forward, with a
poker in his hands. He was tracing a
woman&#8217;s name in the ashes, though he
was hardly conscious of the act. Will&#8217;s
head was thrown back against his chair;
he seemed to be asleep. But when Aspatria
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
opened the door, he sat upright and
looked at her. A pallor like death spread
over his face; it was the crimson shawl, his
mother&#8217;s shawl, which caused it. Wearing
it, Aspatria closely resembled her. Will
had idolized his mother in life, and he worshipped
her memory. If Aspatria had
considered every earthly way of touching
Will&#8217;s heart, she could have selected none
so certain as the shawl, almost accidentally
assumed.</p>
<p>She went direct to Will. He drew a
low stool to his side, and Aspatria sat
down upon it, and then stretched out her
left hand to Brune. The two men looked
at their sister, and then they looked at
each other. The look was a vow. Both
so understood it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will and Brune,&#8221; the girl spoke softly,
but with a great steadiness,&mdash;&#8220;Will and
Brune, I am sorry to have given you so
much shame and trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not your fault, Aspatria,&#8221; said
Brune.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I will do so no more. I will never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
name Ulfar again. I will try to be cheerful
and to make home cheerful, try to
carry on life as it used to be before he
came. We will not let people talk of him,
we will not mind it if they do. Eh, Will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just now, dear, in a little while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will, dear Will! what did that card
mean,&mdash;the one Ulfar&#8217;s friend gave? You
will not go near Ulfar, Will? Please do not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a bit of business to settle with
him, Aspatria, and then I never want to
see his face again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will, you must not go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but I must. I have been thought
of with a lot of bad names, but no one
shall think &#8216;coward&#8217; of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will, remember all I have suffered
to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not likely to forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ride home, Will, was as if I was
going up Calvary. My wedding-dress
was heavy as a cross, and that foolish
wreath of flowers was a wreath of cruel
thorns. I was pitied and scorned, till I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
felt as if my heart&mdash;my real heart&mdash;was
all bruised and torn. I have suffered
so much, Will, spare me more suffering.
Will! Will! for your little sister&#8217;s sake,
put that card in the fire, and stay here,
right here with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My lass! my dear lass, you cannot tell
what you are asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am asking you to give up your revenge.
I know that is a great thing for
a man to do. But, Will, dear, you stand
in father&#8217;s place, you are sitting in father&#8217;s
chair; what would he say to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would say, &#8216;Give the rascal a good
thrashing, Will. When a man wrongs a
woman, there is no other punishment for
him. Thrash him to within an inch of his
cruel, selfish, contemptible life!&#8217; That is
what father would say, Aspatria. I know
it, I feel it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will not give up your revenge
for me, nor yet for father, then I ask you
for mother&#8217;s sake! What would mother
say to-night if she were here?&mdash;very like
she is here. Listen to her, Will. She is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
saying, &#8216;Spare my little girl any more
sorrow and shame, Will, my boy Will!&#8217;&mdash;that
is what mother would say. And if
you hurt Ulfar you hurt me also, and if
Ulfar hurts you my heart will break. The
fell-side is ringing now with my troubles.
If I have any more, I will go away where
no one can find me. For mother&#8217;s sake,
Will! For mother&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>
<p>The strong man was sobbing behind his
hands, the struggle was a terrific one.
Brune watched it with tears streaming unconsciously
down his cheeks. Aspatria
sunk at Will&#8217;s feet, and buried her face on
his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;For mother&#8217;s sake, Will! Let Ulfar
go free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear little lass, I cannot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For mother&#8217;s sake, Will! I am speaking
for mother! For mother&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, what shall I do, Brune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For mother&#8217;s sake, Will!&#8221;</p>
<p>He trembled until the chair shook. He
dared not look at the weeping girl. She
rose up. She gently moved away his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
hands. She kissed his eyelids. She said,
with an irresistible entreaty: &#8220;Look at me,
Will. I am speaking for mother. Let
Ulfar alone. I do not say forgive him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, I will never forgive him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But let him alone. Will! Will! let
him alone, for mother&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he stood up. He looked into
Aspatria&#8217;s eyes; he let his gaze wander to
the crimson shawl. He began to sob like
a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may go, Aspatria,&#8221; he said, in
broken words. &#8220;If you ask me anything
in mother&#8217;s name, I have no power to
say no.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked to the window and looked
out into the dark stormy night, and Brune
motioned to Aspatria to go away. He
knew Will would regain himself better in
her absence. She was glad to go. As
soon as Will had granted her request, she
fell to the lowest ebb of life. She could
hardly drag herself up the long, dark stairs.
She dropped asleep as soon as she reached
her room.</p>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>It was a</span> bitter
awakening. The
soul feels sorrow
keenest at the first
moments of consciousness.
It has
been away, perhaps,
in happy scenes, or
it has been lulling
itself in deep repose,
and then suddenly it
is called to lift again
the heavy burden of
its daily life. Aspatria
stood in her cold,
dim room; and even
while shivering in her thin
night-dress, with bare feet
treading the polished oak floor,
she hastily put out of her sight
the miserable wedding-garments. A large
dower-chest stood conveniently near. She
opened it wide, and flung dress and wreath
and slippers and cloak into it. The lid
fell from her hands with a great clang, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
she said to herself, &#8220;I will never open it
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The storm still continued. She dressed
in simple household fashion, and went
downstairs. Brune sat by the fire. He
said: &#8220;I was waiting for you, Aspatria.
Will is in the barn. He had his coffee
and bacon long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brune, will you be my friend through
all this trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will stand by you through thick
and thin, Aspatria. There is my hand
on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>About great griefs we do not chatter;
and there was no further discussion of
those events which had been barely turned
away from tragedy and death. Murder
and despairing love and sorrow might
have a secret dwelling-place in Seat-Ambar,
but it was in the background.
The front of life went on as smoothly as
ever; the cows were milked, the sheep
tended, the men and maids had their tasks,
the beds were made, and the tables set,
with the usual order and regularity.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>And Aspatria found this &#8220;habit of living&#8221;
to be a good staff to lean upon. She
assumed certain duties, and performed
them; and the house was pleasanter for
her oversight. Will and Brune came far
oftener to sit at the parlour fireside, when
they found Aspatria there to welcome
them. And so the days and weeks followed
one another, bringing with them
those commonplace duties and interests
which give to existence a sense of stability
and order. No one spoke of Fenwick; but
all the more Aspatria nursed his image in
her heart and her imagination. He had
dressed himself for his marriage with great
care and splendour. Never had he looked
so handsome and so noble in her eyes,
and never until that hour had she realized
her social inferiority to him, her lack of
polish and breeding, her ignorance of all
things which a woman of birth and wealth
ought to know and to possess.</p>
<p>This was a humiliating acknowledgment;
but it was Aspatria&#8217;s first upward
step, for with it came an invincible determination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
to make herself worthy of her
husband&#8217;s love and companionship. The
hope and the object gave a new colour to
her life. As she went about her simple
duties, as she sat alone in her room, as
she listened to her brothers talking, it
occupied, strengthened, and inspired her.
Dark as the present was, it held the hope
of a future which made her blush and
tingle to its far-off joy. To learn everything,
to go everywhere, to become a
brilliant woman, a woman of the world, to
make her husband admire and adore her,&mdash;these
were the dreams that brightened the
long, sombre winter, and turned the low
dim rooms into a palace of enchantment.</p>
<p>She was aware of the difficulties in her
way. She thought first of asking Will to
permit her to go to a school in London.
But she knew he would never consent.
She had no friends to whom she could
confide her innocent plans, she had as yet
no money in her own control. But in less
than two years she would be of age. Her
fortune would then be at her disposal, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
the law would permit her to order her own
life. In the mean time she could read and
study at home: when the spring came
she would see the vicar, and he would
lend her books from his library.
There was an Encyclopædia in
the house; she got together
its scattered
volumes, and began
to make herself
familiar with its
<i>mélange</i> of information.</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:275px'>

<a name='linki_24' id='linki_24'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0133.jpg' alt='' title='' width='275' height='464' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>In such</span> efforts
her heart was
purified from
all bitterness,
wounded vanity,
and impatience. Life
was neither lonely nor
monotonous, she had a noble
object to work for. So the winter
passed, and the spring came again. All
over the fells the ewes and their lambs
made constant work for the shepherds;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
and Aspatria greatly pleased Will by going
out frequently to pick up the perishing,
weakly lambs and succour them.</p>
<p>One day in April she took a bottle of
warm milk and a bit of sponge and went up
Calder Fell. On the first reach of the
fell she found a dying lamb, and carried it
down to the shelter of some whin-bushes.
Then she fed it with the warm milk, and
the little creature went to sleep in her
arms.</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:351px'>

<a name='linki_25' id='linki_25'></a>

<img src='images/img_0135.jpg' alt='' title='' width='351' height='498' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>The grass was</span> green and fresh, the sun
warm; the whins sheltered her from the
wind, and a little thrush in them, busy
building her nest, was making sweet music
out of air as sweet. All was so glad and
quiet: she, too, was happy in her own
thoughts. A wagon passed, and then a
tax-cart, and afterward two old men going
ditching. She hardly lifted her head;
every one knew Aspatria Anneys. When
the shadows told her that it was near noon,
she rose to go home, holding the lamb in
her arms. At that moment a carriage
came slowly from behind the hedge. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
saw the fine horses with their glittering
harness, and knew it was a strange vehicle
in Ambar-Side, so she sat down
again until it should pass. The lamb was
in her left arm. She threw back her head,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
and gazed fixedly into the whin-bush where
the thrush had its nest. Whoever it was,
she did not wish to be recognized.</p>
<p>Lady Redware, Sarah Sandys, and Ulfar
Fenwick were in the carriage. At the
moment she stood with the lamb in her
arms, Ulfar had known his wife. Lady
Redware saw her almost as quickly, and in
some occult way she transferred, by a
glance, the knowledge to Sarah. The carriage
was going very slowly; the beauty
of the thrown-back head, the simplicity of
her dress, the pastoral charm of her position,
all were distinct. Ulfar looked at her
with a fire of passion in his eyes, Lady
Redware with annoyance. Sarah asked,
with a mocking laugh, &#8220;Is that really
Little Bo Peep?&#8221; The joke fell flat.
Ulfar did not immediately answer it; and
Sarah was piqued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall go to Italy again,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Englishmen may be admirable <i>en masse</i>,
but individually they are stupid or cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Italy there are the Capuchins,&#8221; answered
Ulfar. He remembered that Sarah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
had expressed herself strongly about the
order.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just passed a week at Oxford
among the Reverends; all things considered,
I prefer the Capuchins. When you
have dined with a lord bishop, you want
to become a socialist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Oxford friends are very nice
people, Sarah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent people, Elizabeth, quite superior
people, and they are all sure not only
of going to heaven, but also of joining
the very best society the place affords.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Best society!&#8221; said Ulfar, pettishly.
&#8220;I am going to America. There, I hope,
I shall hear nothing about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;America is so truly admirable. Why
was it put in such an out-of-the-way place?
You have to sail three thousand miles to
get to it,&#8221; pouted Sarah.</p>
<p>&#8220;All things worth having are put out of
the way,&#8221; replied Ulfar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sighed Sarah. &#8220;What an admirable
story is that of the serpent and
the apple!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Come, Ulfar!&#8221; said Lady Redware,
&#8220;do try to be agreeable. You used to
be so delightful! Was he not, Sarah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was he? I have forgotten, Elizabeth.
Since that time a great deal of water has
run into the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want an ill-natured opinion
about yourself, by all means go to a
woman for it.&#8221; And Ulfar enunciated
this dictum with a very scornful shrug
of his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ulfar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so, Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind him, dear!&#8221; said Sarah.
&#8220;I do not. And I have noticed that the
men who give bad characters to women
have usually much worse ones themselves.
I think Ulfar is quite ready for American
society and its liberal ideas.&#8221; And Sarah
drew her shawl into her throat, and looked
defiantly at Ulfar.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Americans are all socialists. I
have read that, Ulfar. You know what
these liberal ideas come to,&mdash;always
socialism.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do not be foolish, Elizabeth. Socialism
never comes from liberality of thought:
it is always a bequest of tyranny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ulfar, when are you going to be really
nice and good again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know, Elizabeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ulfar is a standing exception to the
rule that when things are at their worst
they must mend. Ulfar, lately, is always
at his worst, and he never mends.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was really some excuse for Ulfar;
he was suffering keenly, and neither of the
two women cared to recognize the fact.
He had just returned from Italy with his
father&#8217;s remains, and after their burial he
had permitted Elizabeth to carry him off
with her to Redware. In reality the neighbourhood
of Aspatria drew him like a magnet.
He had been haunted by her last,
resentful, amazed, miserable look. He
understood from it that Will had never
told her of his intention to bid her farewell
as soon as she was his wife, and he was
not devoid of imagination. His mind had
constantly pictured scenes of humiliation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
which he had condemned the woman he
had once so tenderly loved to endure.</p>
<p>And that passing glimpse of her under
the whin-bushes had revived something of
his old passion. He answered his sister&#8217;s
and Sarah&#8217;s remarks pettishly, because he
wanted to be left alone with the new hope
that had come to him. Why not take
Aspatria to America? She was his wife.
He had been compelled, by his sense of
justice and honour, to make her Lady Fenwick;
why should he deny himself her
company, merely to keep a passionate,
impulsive threat?</p>
<p>To the heart the past is eternal, and
love survives the pang of separation. He
thought of Aspatria for the next twenty-four
hours. To see her! to speak to her!
to hear her voice! to clasp her to his
heart! Why should he deny himself these
delights? What pleasure could pride and
temper give him in exchange? Fenwick
had always loved to overcome an obstacle,
and such people cannot do without
obstacles; they are a necessary aliment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
To see and to speak with Aspatria was
now the one thing in life worthy of his
attention.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>It was not</span> an easy thing to accomplish.
Every day for nearly a
week he rode furiously to
Calder Wood, tied his horse
there, and then hung about
the brow of Calder Cliff, for
it commanded Seat-Ambar,
which lay below it as the
street lies below a high
tower. With his
glass he could see Will
and Brune passing from the
house to the barns or the fields,
and once he saw Aspatria go to
meet her brother Will; he saw her
lift her face to Will&#8217;s face, he saw
Will put her arm through his arm
and so go with her to the house.
How he hated Will Anneys!
What a triumph it would be to
carry off his sister unknown to him and
without his say-so!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>One morning he determined if he found
no opportunity to see Aspatria that day
alone he would risk all, and go boldly to
the house. Why should he not do so?
He had scarcely made the decision when
he saw Will and Brune drive away together.
He remembered it was Dalton
market-day; and he knew that they had
gone there. Almost immediately Aspatria
left the house also. Then he was jealous.
Where was she going as soon as her
brothers left her? She was going to the
vicar&#8217;s to return a book and carry him a
cream cheese of her own making.</p>
<p>He knew then how to meet her. She
would pass through a meadow on her way
home, and this meadow was skirted by a
young plantation. Half-way down there
was a broad stile between the two. He
hurried his steps, and arrived there just
as Aspatria entered the meadow. There
was a high frolicking wind blowing right
in her face. It had blown her braids loose,
and her tippet and dress backward; her
slim form was sharply defined by it, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
it compelled her to hold up both her
hands in order to keep her hat on her
head.</p>
<p>She came on so, treading lightly, almost
dancing with the merry gusts to and fro.
Once Ulfar heard a little cry that was half
laughter, as the wind made her pirouette
and then stand still to catch her breath.
Ulfar thought the picture bewitching. He
waited until she was within a yard or two
of the stile, ere he crossed it. She was
holding her hat down: she did not see
him until he could have put his hand upon
her. Then she let her hands fall, and her
hat blew backward, and she stood quite
still and quite speechless, her colour coming
and going, all a woman&#8217;s softest
witchery beaming in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aspatria! dear Aspatria! I am come
to take you with me. I am going to
America.&#8221; He spoke a little sadly, as if
he had some reason for feeling grieved.</p>
<p>She shook her head positively, but she
did not, or she could not, speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aspatria, have you no kiss, no word of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
welcome, no love to give me?&#8221; And he
put out his hand, as if to draw her to his
embrace.</p>
<p>She stepped quickly backward: &#8220;No,
no, no! Do not touch me, Ulfar. Go
away. Please go away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must go with me. You are
my wife, Aspatria.&#8221; And he said the last
words very like a command.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not your wife. Oh, no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say you are. I married you in
Aspatria Church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You also left me there, left me to such
shame and sorrow as no man gives to the
woman he loves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I did act cruelly in two or
three ways, Aspatria; but people who love
forgive two or three offences. Let us be
lovers as we used to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I will not be lovers as we used to
be. People who love do not commit two
or three such offences as you committed
against me.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;I will atone for them. I will indeed!
Aspatria, I miss you very much. I will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
not go to America without you. How
soon can you be ready? In a week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will atone to me? How? There
is but one way. You shall, in your own
name, call every one in Allerdale, gentle
and simple, to Aspatria Church. You
shall marry me again in their presence,
and go with me to my own home. The
wedding-feast shall be held there. You
shall count Will and Brune Anneys as
your brothers. You shall take me away,
in the sight of all, to your home. Of all
the honour a wife ought to have you must
give me here, among my own people, a
double portion. Will you do this in
atonement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are talking folly, Aspatria. I
have married you once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not married me once. You
met me at Aspatria Church to shame me,
to break my heart with love and sorrow,
to humble my good brothers. No, I am
not your wife! I will not go with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make you go, Aspatria. You
seem to forget the law&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Will says the law will protect me.
But if it did not, if you took me by force
to your house or yacht, you would not
have me. You could not touch me. Aspatria
Anneys is beyond your reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Aspatria Fenwick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never taken your name. Will
told me not to do so. Anneys is a good
name. No Anneys ever wronged me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You refused my home, you refused
my money, and now you refuse my name.
You are treating me as badly as possible.
The day before our marriage I sent to
your brother a signed settlement for your
support, the use of Fenwick Castle as a
residence, and two thousand pounds a
year. Your brother Will, the day after
our marriage, took it to my agent and tore
it to pieces in his presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will did right. He knew his sister
would not have your home and money
without your love.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke calmly, with a dignity that
became well her youth and beauty. Ulfar
thought her exceedingly lovely. He attempted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
to woo her again with the tender
glances and soft tones and caressing touch
of their early acquaintance. Aspatria
sorrowfully withdrew herself; she held only
repelling palms toward his bending face.
She was not coy, he could have overcome
coyness; she was cold, and calm, and
watchful of him and of herself. Her face
and throat paled and blushed, and blushed
and paled; her eyes were dilated with feeling;
her pretty bow-shaped mouth trembled;
she radiated a personality sweet,
strong, womanly,&mdash;a piquant, woodland,
pastoral delicacy, all her own.</p>
<p>But after many useless efforts to influence
her, he began to despair. He perceived
that she still loved him, perhaps
better than she had ever done, but that
her determination to consider their marriage
void had its source in a oneness of
mind having no second thoughts and no
doubt behind it. The only hope she gave
him was in another marriage ceremony
which in its splendour and publicity should
atone in some measure for the first. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
could not contemplate such a confession
of his own fault. He could not give Will
and Brune Anneys such a triumph. If
Aspatria loved him, how could she ask
such a humiliating atonement? Aspatria
saw the shadow of these reflections on his
face. Though he said nothing, she understood
it was this struggle that gave the
momentary indecision to his pleading.</p>
<p>For herself, she did not desire a present
reconciliation. She had nursed too long
the idea of the Aspatria that was to be, the
wise, clever, brilliant woman who was to
win over again her husband. She did not
like to relinquish this hope for a present
gratification, a gratification so much lower
in its aim that she now understood that it
never could long satisfy a nature so complex
and so changeable as Ulfar&#8217;s. She
therefore refused him his present hope,
believing that fate had a far better meeting
in store for them.</p>
<p>While these thoughts flashed through
her mind, she kept her eyes upon the
horizon. In that wide-open fixed gaze her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
loving, troubled soul revealed itself. Ulfar
was wondering whether it was worth while
to begin his argument all over again, when
she said softly: &#8220;We must now say farewell.
I see the vicar&#8217;s maid coming. In
a few hours the fell-side will know of our
meeting. I must tell Will, myself. I
entreat you to leave the dales as soon as
possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not leave them without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to-night. I shall not change what
I have said. There is nothing to be done
but to part. We are no longer alone.
Good-by, Ulfar!&mdash;dear Ulfar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I care not who is present. You are
my wife.&#8221; And he clasped her in his
arms and kissed her.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was not sorry. Perhaps
her own glance of love and longing had
commanded the embrace; for when she
released herself she was weeping, and
Ulfar&#8217;s tears were on her cheeks. But
she called the vicar&#8217;s maid imperatively,
and so put an end to the interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was my husband, Lottie,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
said. It was the only explanation offered.
Aspatria knew it was useless to expect any
reticence on the subject. In that isolated
valley such a piece of news could not be
kept; the very birds would talk about
it in their nests. She must herself tell
Will, and although she had done nothing
wrong, she was afraid to tell him.</p>
<p>When she reached home she was glad
to hear that Will had been sent for to
Squire Frostham&#8217;s. &#8220;It was something
about a fox,&#8221; said Brune. &#8220;They wanted
me too, but Alice Frostham is a girl I cannot
abide. I would not go near her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brune, will you take a long ride for
my sake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do anything for you I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I met Ulfar Fenwick this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you did a bad thing. I would
not have believed it of you. Good Lord!
there is as much two-facedness in a woman
as there is meat in an egg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brune, you are thinking wrong. I
did not know he was in the country till
he stood before me; and he did not move
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
me a hair&#8217;s-breadth any way. But Lottie
from the vicarage saw us together; and
she was going to Dalton. You know what
she will say; and by and by the Frosthams
will hear; and then they will feel it to be
&#8216;only kind&#8217; to talk to Will about me and
my affairs; and the end of it will be some
foolish deed or other. If you love me,
Brune, go to Redware to-night, and see
Lady Redware, and tell her there is danger
for her brother if he stays around
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can say that truly. There is danger
for the scoundrel, a good deal of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brune, it would be such a sorrow to
me if every one were talking of me again.
Do what I ask you, Brune. You promised
to stand by me through thick and thin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did; and I will go to Redware as
soon as I have eaten my dinner. If Lottie
saw him, it will be known all over. And
if no one came up here on purpose to tell
Will, he would hear it at Dalton next week,
when that lot of bothering old squires sit
down to their market dinner. It would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
be a grand bit for them to chew with their
victuals.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;I thought</span> they talked about politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are like other men. If you get
more than one man in a
place, they are talking bad
about some woman. They
call it politics, but it is mostly
slander.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to tell Will myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a deal the best plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure to frighten Lady Redware;
make her think Ulfar&#8217;s life is in danger,&mdash;anything
to get him out of the dales.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will feel as if the heavens were
going to fall, when I get done with her.
My word! who would have thought of him
coming back? Life is full of surprises.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But only think, if there was never anything
accidental happened! Surprises are
just what make life worth having,&mdash;eh,
Brune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so, and maybe not. When
Will comes home, tell him everything at
once. I can manage Lady Redware, I&#8217;ll
be bound.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the promise he went away to perform
it, and Aspatria carried her trembling
heart into solitude. But the lonely place
was full of Ulfar. A thousand hopes were
budding in her heart, growing slowly,
strongly, sweetly, in that earth which
she had made for them out of her love,
her desires, her hopes, and her faithful
aspirations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />BUT THEY WERE YOUNG.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Brune arrived at Redware Hall while
it was still afternoon, and he found no difficulty
in obtaining an interview with its
mistress. She was sitting at a table in a
large bay-window, painting the view from
it. For in those days ladies were not
familiar with high art and all its nomenclature
and accessories; Lady Redware had
never thought of an easel, or a blouse, or
indeed of any of the trappings now considered
necessary to the making of pictures.
She was prettily dressed in silk;
and a square of bristol-board, a box of
Newman&#8217;s water-colours, and a few camel&#8217;s-hair
pencils were neatly arranged before
her.</p>
<p>She rose when Brune entered, and met
him with a suave courtesy; and the unsophisticated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
young man took it for a genuine
pleasure. He felt sorry to trouble
such a nice-looking gentlewoman, and he
said so with a sincerity that made her suddenly
serious. &#8220;Have you brought me
bad news, Mr. Anneys?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid you will be put about a
bit. Sir Ulfar Fenwick met my sister this
morning; and they were seen by ill-natured
eyes, and I came, quiet-like, to let you know
that he must leave the dales to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cannot Sir Ulfar meet his own wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Redware, that is not the question.
Put it, &#8216;Cannot Sir Ulfar meet your
sister?&#8217; and I will answer you quick
enough, &#8216;Not while there are two honest
men in Allerdale to prevent him.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot frighten Sir Ulfar from
Allerdale. To threaten him is to make
him stay.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_30' id='linki_30'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0157.jpg' alt='' title='' width='425' height='486' />
<br />
</div>
<p>&#8220;Dalesmen are not ones to threaten. I
tell you that the vicar&#8217;s maid saw Sir Ulfar
and my sister together; and when William
Anneys hears of it, Sir Ulfar will get such
a notice to leave these parts as will give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
him no choice. I came to warn him away
before he could not help himself. I say
freely, I did so to please Aspatria, and out
of no good-will going his way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he will not leave Allerdale?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if William Anneys, and the sixty
gentlemen who will ride with William
Anneys, say he must go? What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course Sir Ulfar cannot fight a
mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one of that mob of gentlemen
would fight him; but they all carry stout
riding-whips.&#8221; And Brune looked at the
lady with a sombre intentness which made
further speech unnecessary. She had been
alarmed from the first; she now made no
further attempt to disguise her terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;What must I do, Mr. Anneys?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;What must I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send your brother away from Cumberland
to-night. I say he must leave
to-night. To-morrow morning may be too
late to prevent a great humiliation. Aspatria
begged me to come to you. I do not
say I wanted to come.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>At this moment the door opened, and
Sarah Sandys entered. Brune turned, and
saw her; and his heart stood still. She
came slowly forward, her garment
of pale-green and
white just touching
her sandalled feet.
She had a rush basket
full of violets in
her hands; there
were primroses in
her breast and belt,
and her face was
like a pink rose.
High on her head her
fair hair was lifted, and,
being fastened with a
large turquoise comb, it
gave the idea of sunshine and
blue sky.</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:213px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_31' id='linki_31'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0159.jpg' alt='' title='' width='213' height='425' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>Brune stood looking</span> at her, as a mortal
might look at the divine Cytherea made
manifest. His handsome, open face, full
of candid admiration, had almost an august
character. He bowed to her, as men bow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
when they bend their heart and give its
homage and delight. Sarah was much
impressed by the young man&#8217;s beauty, and
she felt his swift adoration of her own
charms. She made Lady Redware introduce
her to Brune, and she completed her
conquest of the youth as she stood a
moment holding his hand and smiling with
captivating grace into his eyes.</p>
<p>Then Lady Redware explained Brune&#8217;s
mission, and Sarah grasped the situation
without any disguises. &#8220;It simply means
flight, Elizabeth,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What could
Ulfar do with fifty or sixty angry Cumberland
squires? He would have to go. In
fact, I know they have a method of persuasion
no mortal man can resist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brune saw that his errand was accomplished.
Lady Redware thanked him for
his consideration, and Sarah rang for the
tea-service, and made him a cup, and gave
it to him with her own lovely hands.
Brune saw their exquisite form, their translucent
glow, the sparkling of diamonds
and emeralds upon them. The tea was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
as if brewed in Paradise; it tasted of all
things delightful; it was a veritable cup
of enchantments.</p>
<p>Then Brune rode away, and the two
women watched him over the hill. He
sat his great black hunter like a cavalry
officer; and the creature devoured the
distance with strides that made their hearts
leap to the sense of its power and life.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the very handsomest man I ever
saw!&#8221; said Sarah.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is to be done about Ulfar?
Sarah, you must manage this business.
He will not listen to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ulfar has five senses. Ulfar is very
fond of himself. He will leave Redware,
of course. How handsome Brune Anneys
is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you coax him to leave to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ulfar? Yes, I will; for it is the proper
thing for him to do. It would be a shame
to bring his quarrels to your house.&mdash;What
a splendid rider! Look, Elizabeth, he is
just topping the hill! I do believe he
turned his head! Is he not handsome?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
Apollo! Antinoüs! Pshaw! Brune Anneys
is a great deal more human, and a
great deal more godlike, than either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be silly, Sarah. And do occupy
yourself a little with Ulfar now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When the hour comes, I will. Ulfar
is evidently occupying himself at present
in watching his wife. There is a decorous
naughtiness and a stimulating sense of
danger about seeing Aspatria, that must
be a thorough enjoyment to Ulfar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Men are always in fusses. Ulfar has
kept my heart palpitating ever since he
could walk alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah sighed. &#8220;It is very difficult,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;to decide whether very old men
or very young men can be the greater
trial. The suffering both can cause is immense!
Poor Sandys was sixty-six, and
Ulfar is thirty-six, and&mdash;&#8221; She shook
her head, and sighed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;How hateful country-people are!&#8221; exclaimed
Elizabeth. &#8220;They must talk, no
matter what tragedy they cause with their
scandalous words.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Are they worse than our own set,
either in town or country? You know
what the Countess of Denbigh considered
pleasant conversation?&mdash;telling things
that ought not to be told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Countess is a wretch! she would
tell the most sacred of secrets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell secrets also. I do not consider
it wrong. What business has any one to
throw the <i>onus</i> of keeping their secret on
my shoulders? Why should they expect
from me more prudence than they themselves
have shown?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true. But in these valleys they
speak so uncomfortably direct; nothing
but the strongest, straightest, most definite
words will be used.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a pity. People ought to send
scandal through society in a respectable
hunt-the-slipper form of circulation. But
that is a kind of decency to be cultivated.
However, I shall tell Ulfar, in the plainest
words I can find, that there will be about
sixty Cumberland squires here to-morrow,
to ride with him out of the county, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
that they are looking forward to the fun
of it just as much as if it was a fox-hunt.
Ulfar has imagination. He will be able
to conceive such a ride,&mdash;the flying man,
and the roaring, laughing, whip-cracking
squires after him! He will remember
how Tom Appleton the wrestler, who did
something foul, was escorted across the
county line last summer. And Ulfar hates
a scene. Can you fancy him making himself
the centre of such an affair?&#8221;</p>
<p>So they talked while Brune galloped
homeward in a very happy mood. He
felt as those ancients may have felt when
they met the Immortals and saluted them.
The thought of the beautiful Mrs. Sandys
filled his imagination; but he talked comfortably
to Aspatria, and assured her that
there was now no fear of a meeting between
her husband and Will. &#8220;Only,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;tell Will yourself to-night, and he
will never doubt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Will did not return that
night from the Frosthams&#8217;; for in the morning
the two men were to go together to Dalton
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
very early. Will heard nothing there,
but Mrs. Frostham was waiting at her garden
gate to tell him when he returned. He
had left Squire Frostham with his son-in-law,
and was alone. Mrs. Frostham made
a great deal of the information, and broke
it to Will with much consideration. Will
heard her sullenly. He was getting a few
words ready for Aspatria, as Mrs. Frostham
told her tale, but they were for her
alone. To Mrs. Frostham he adopted a
tone she thought very ungrateful.</p>
<p>For when the whole affair, real and consequential,
had been told, he answered:
&#8220;What is there to make a wonder of?
Cannot a woman talk and walk a bit with
her own husband? Maybe he had something
very particular to say to her. I think
it is a shame to bother a little lass about a
thing like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he folded himself so close that Mrs.
Frostham could neither question nor sympathize
with him longer. &#8220;Good-evening
to you,&#8221; he said coldly; and then, while
visible, he took care to ride as if quite at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
his ease. But the moment the road turned
from Frostham he whipped his horse to
its full speed, and entered the farmyard
with it in a foam of hurry, and himself
in a foam of passion.</p>
<p>Aspatria met him with the confession on
her lips. He gave her no time. He assailed
her with affronting and injurious
epithets. He pushed her hands and face
from him. He vowed her tears were a
mockery, and her intention of confessing a
lie. He met all her efforts at explanation,
and all her attempts to pacify him, at
sword-point.</p>
<p>She bore it patiently for a while; and
then Will Anneys saw an Aspatria he had
never dreamed of. She seemed to grow
taller; she did really grow taller; her face
flamed, her eyes flashed, and, in a voice
authoritative and irresistible, she commanded
him to desist.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are my worst enemy,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You are as deaf as the village gossips.
You will not listen to the truth. Your
abuse, heard by every servant in the house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
certifies all that malice dares to think.
And in wounding my honour you are
a parricide to our mother&#8217;s good name!
I am ashamed of you, Will!&#8221;</p>
<p>From head to foot she reflected the indignation
in her heart, as she stood erect
with her hands clasped and the palms
dropped downward, no sign of tears, no
quiver of fear or doubt, no retreat, and no
submission, in her face or attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, whatever is the matter with you,
Aspatria?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment Brune entered, and she
went to him, and put her hand through
his arm, and said: &#8220;Brune, speak for me!
Will has insulted mother and father,
through me, in such a way that I can
never forgive him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
Will Anneys!&#8221; And Brune put his sister
gently behind him, and then marched
squarely up to his brother&#8217;s face. &#8220;You
are as passionate as a brute beast, Will,
and that, too, with a poor little lass that
has her own troubles, and has borne
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
them like&mdash;like a good woman always
does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not want to hear you speak,
Brune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, but I will speak, and you shall
hear me. I tell you, Aspatria is in no kind
to blame. The man came on her sudden,
out of the plantation. She did not take
his hand, she did not listen to him. She
sent him about his business as quick as
might be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lottie Patterson saw her,&#8221; said Will,
dourly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Aspatria called Lottie Patterson
to her; and if Lottie Patterson says
she saw anything more or worse than
ought to be, I will pretty soon call upon
Seth Patterson to make his sister&#8217;s words
good. Cush! I will that! And what is
more, Will Anneys, if you do not know
how to take care of your sister&#8217;s good
name, I will teach you,&mdash;you mouse of a
man! You go and side with that Frostham
set against Aspatria! Chaff on the Frosthams!
It is a bad neighbourhood where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
a girl like Aspatria cannot say a word or
two on the king&#8217;s highway at broad noonday,
without having a <i>sisserara</i> about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not side with the Frosthams
against Aspatria.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be bound you did!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me alone, Brune! Go your ways
out of here, both of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, we will both go. Come,
Aspatria. When you are tired of ballooning,
William Anneys, and can come down
to common justice, maybe then I will talk
to you,&mdash;not till.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, good honest anger is one of the
sinews of the soul; and he that wants it
when there is occasion has but a maimed
mind. The hot words, the passionate atmosphere,
the rebellion of Aspatria, the
decision of Brune, had the same effect
upon Will&#8217;s senseless anger as a thunder-storm
has upon the hot, heavy, summer
air. Will raged his bad temper away, and
was cool and clear-minded after it.</p>
<p>At the same hour the same kind of
mental thunder-storm was prevailing over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
all common-sense at Redware Hall. Ulfar,
after a long and vain watch for another
opportunity to speak to Aspatria, returned
there in a temper compounded of anger,
jealousy, disappointment, and unsatisfied
affection. He heard Lady Redware&#8217;s
story of his own danger
and of Brune&#8217;s consideration
with scornful indifference.
Brune&#8217;s consideration
he laughed at.
He knew very well, he
answered, that Brune
Anneys hated him, and
would take the greatest
delight in such a hubbub
as he pretended was in
project.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>&#8220;But he came</span> to please
Aspatria,&#8221; continued Lady
Redware. &#8220;He said he came only to
please Aspatria.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So Aspatria wishes me to leave Allerdale?
I will not go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah, he will not go,&#8221; cried Lady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
Redware, as her friend entered the room.
&#8220;He says he will not go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is because you have appealed to
Ulfar&#8217;s feelings instead of to his judgment.
When Ulfar considers how savagely primitive
these dalesmen are in their passions,
he will understand that discretion is the
nobler part of valour. In Russia he
thought it a very prudent thing to get out
of the way when a pack of wolves were in
the neighbourhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The law will protect me in this house.
Human beings have to mind the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are times when human beings
are a law unto themselves. How would
you like to see a crowd of angry men
shouting around this house for you?
Think of your sister,&mdash;and of me, if I am
worth so much consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not to be frightened, Sarah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you consider, then, that as far as
Keswick and Kendal on one side, and as
far as Dalton and Whitehaven on the other
side, every local newspaper will have, or
will make, its own version of the affair?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
The Earl of Lonsdale, with a large party,
is now at Whitehaven Castle. What a
<i>sauce piquante</i> it will be to his dinners!
How the men will howl over it, and how
the women will snicker and smile!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah! you can think of the hatefullest
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Lonsdale will go up to London
purposely to have the delight of telling it
at the clubs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the &#8216;Daily Whisper&#8217; will get
Lonsdale&#8217;s most delectable version, and
blow it with the four winds of heaven to
the four corners of the civilized world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah Sandys, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse still! that poor girl whom you
treated so abominably, must suffer the
whole thing over again. Her name will be
put as the head and front of your offending.
All her sorrows and heartbreak will
be made a penny mouthful for country
bumpkins and scandalous gammers to
&#8216;Oh!&#8217; and &#8216;Ah!&#8217; over. Ulfar, if you are
a man, you will not give her a moment&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
terror of such consequences. You may
see that she fears them, by her sending her
brother to entreat your absence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I must be called coward and
runaway!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them call you anything they like,
so that you spare her further shame and
sorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your talking in this fashion to me,
Sarah, is very like Satan correcting sin.
I loved Aspatria when I met you in
Rome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! Adam always has his Eve
ready. &#8216;Not my fault, good people!
Look at this woman! With her bright
smiles and her soft tongue she beguiled
me; and so I fell!&#8217; We can settle that
question, you and I, again. Now you
must ring the bell, and order your horse&mdash;say,
at four o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning.
You can have nearly six hours&#8217; sleep,&mdash;quite
enough for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not convinced me, Sarah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must ride now, and be convinced
afterward. For your sister&#8217;s sake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
and for Aspatria&#8217;s sake, you will surely go
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Redware was crying, and she cried
a little harder to emphasize Sarah&#8217;s pleading.
Ulfar was in a hard strait. He
looked angrily at the handsome little
woman urging him to do the thing he
hated to do, and then taking the kerchief
from his sister&#8217;s face, he kissed her, and
promised to leave Redware at dawn of
day.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if you send me away
now, I tell you, our parting is likely to be
for many years, perhaps for life. I am
going beyond civilization, and so beyond
scandal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not flatter yourself so extravagantly,
Ulfar. There is scandal everywhere,
and always has been, even from
the beginning. I have no doubt those
nameless little sisters of Cain and Abel
were talked about unpleasantly by their
sisters and brothers-in-law. In fact, wherever
there are women there are men glad
to pull them down to their own level.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is it not very hard,
then, that I am not to
be permitted to stay
here and defend the
women I love?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah shook her
head. &#8220;It is beyond
your power, Ulfar. If
Porthos were on earth
again, or Amadis of
Gaul, they might have
happy and useful careers
in handling as they
deserve the maligners
of good, quiet women.
But the men of this
era!&mdash;which of them
durst lift the stone that
the hand without sin is
permitted to cast?&#8221;</p>

</div>
<img src='images/img_0175.jpg' alt='' title='' width='192' height='600' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>So they talked</span> the
night away, drifting
gradually from the unpleasant
initial subject to
Ulfar&#8217;s plan of travel and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
the far-off prospect of his return. And in
the gray, cold dawn he bade them farewell,
and they watched him until he vanished in
the mists rolling down the mountain. Then
they kissed each other,&mdash;a little, sad kiss
of congratulation, wet with tears; they had
won their desire, but their victory had left
them weeping. Alas! it is the very condition
of success that every triumph must be
baptized with somebody&#8217;s tears.</p>
<p>This event, beginning in such a trifle as
an almost accidental visit of Aspatria to
the vicar, was the line sharply dividing
very different lives. Nothing in Seat-Ambar
was ever quite the same after it.
William Anneys, indeed, quickly perceived
and acknowledged his fault, and the reconciliation
was kind and complete; but Aspatria
had taken a step forward, and crossed
clearly that bound which divides girlhood
from womanhood. Unconsciously she assumed
a carriage that Will felt compelled
to respect, and a tone was in her voice he
did not care to bluff and contradict. He
never again ordered her to remain silent or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
to leave his presence. A portion of his
household authority had passed from him,
both as regarded Aspatria and Brune; and
he felt himself to be less master than he
had formerly been.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was one reason of the growing
frequency of his visits to Frostham.
There he was made much of, deferred to,
and all his little fancies flattered and
obeyed. Will knew he was the most important
person in the world to Alice
Frostham; and he knew, also, that he
only shared Aspatria&#8217;s heart with Ulfar
Fenwick. Men like the whole heart, and
nothing less than the whole heart; hence
Alice&#8217;s influence grew steadily all through
the summer days, full to the brim of happy
labour and reasonable love. As early as
the haymaking Will told Aspatria that
Alice was coming to Seat-Ambar as its
mistress; and when the harvest was gathered
in, the wedding took place. It was
as noisily jocund an affair as Aspatria&#8217;s
had been silent and sorrowful; and Alice
Frostham, encircled by Will&#8217;s protecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
arm, was led across the threshold of her
own new home, to the sound of music and
rejoicing.</p>
<p>The home was quickly divided, though
without unkind intent. Will and Alice had
their own talk, their own hopes and plans,
and Aspatria and Brune generally felt that
their entrance interfered with some discussion.
So Aspatria and Brune began to
sit a great deal in Aspatria&#8217;s room, and by
and by to discuss, in a confidential way,
what they were to do with their future.
Brune had no definite idea. Aspatria&#8217;s
intents were clear and certain. But she
knew that she must wait until the spring
brought her majority and her freedom.</p>
<p>One frosty day, near Christmas, as Brune
was returning from Dalton, he heard himself
called in a loud, cheerful voice. He
was passing Seat-Ketel, and he soon saw
Harry Ketel coming quickly toward him.
Harry wore a splendid scarlet uniform; and
the white snow beneath his feet, and the
dark green pines between which he walked,
made it all the more splendid by their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
contrast. Brune had not seen Harry for
five years; but they had been companions
through their boyhood, and their memories
were stored with the pleasant hours
they had spent together.</p>
<p>Brune passed that night, and many subsequent
ones, with his old friend; and when
Harry went back to his regiment he took
with him a certainty that Brune would
soon follow. In fact, Harry had found his
old companion in that mood which is
ready to accept the first opening as the
gift of fate. Brune found there was a
commission to be bought in the Household
Foot-Guards, and he was well able to
pay for it. Indeed, Brune was by no
means a poor man; his father had left
him seven thousand pounds, and his share
of the farm&#8217;s proceeds had been constantly
added to it.</p>
<p>Aspatria was delighted. She might now
go to London in Brune&#8217;s care. They discussed
the matter constantly, and began
to make the preparations necessary for the
change. But affairs were not then arranged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
by steam and electricity, and the
letters relating to the purchase and transfer
of Brune&#8217;s commission occupied some
months in their transit to and fro; although
Brune did not rely upon the postman&#8217;s
idea of the practicability of the roads.</p>
<p>Aspatria&#8217;s correspondence was also uncertain
and unsatisfactory for some time.
She had at first no guide to a school but
the advertisements in the London papers
which Harry sent to his friend. But one
night Brune, without any special intention,
named the matter to Mrs. Ketel; and that
lady was able to direct Aspatria to an
excellent school in Richmond, near London.
And as she was much more favourably
situated for a quick settlement of
the affair, she undertook the necessary
correspondence.</p>
<p>Will was not ignorant of these movements,
but Alice induced him to be passive
in them. &#8220;No one can then blame us,
Will, whatever happens.&#8221; And as Will
and Alice were extremely sensitive to
public opinion, this was a good consideration.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Besides Alice, not unnaturally,
wished to have the Seat to herself; so
that Aspatria&#8217;s and Brune&#8217;s wishes fitted
admirably into her own desires, and it
gave her a kind of selfish pleasure to
forward them.</p>
<p>The ninth of March was Aspatria&#8217;s
twenty-first birthday; and it was to her a
very important anniversary, for she received
as its gift her freedom and her fortune.
There was no hitch or trouble in
its transfer from Will to herself. Honour
and integrity were in the life-blood of
William Anneys, honesty and justice the
very breath of his nostrils. Aspatria&#8217;s
fortune had been guarded with a super-sensitive
care; and when years gave her its
management, Will surrendered it cheerfully
to her control.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the school selected by
Mrs. Ketel satisfied Will thoroughly; and
Brune&#8217;s commission in the Foot-Guards
was in honourable accord with the highest
traditions and spirit of the dales. For the
gigantic and physically handsome men of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
these mountain valleys have been for centuries
considered the finest material for
those regiments whose duty it is to guard
the
persons
and the
homes of
royalty. Brune
had only followed in the
steps of a great number of his
ancestors.</p>

<br />
</div>
<p>In the beginning of April, Aspatria
left Seat-Ambar for London,&mdash;left
forever all the pettiness of her house life,
chairs and tables, sewing and meals, and
the useless daily labour that has to be continually
done over again. And at the last
Will was very tender with her, and even
Alice did her best to make the parting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
days full of hope and kindness. As for
the journey, there was no anxiety; Brune
was to travel with his sister, and see her
safely within her new home.</p>
<p>Yet neither of them left the old home
without some tears. Would they ever see
again those great, steadfast hills, that
purify those who walk upon them; ever
dwell again within the dear old house, that
had not been builded, but had grown with
the family it had sheltered, through a
thousand years? They hardly spoke to
each other, as they drove through the
sweet valleys, where the sunshine laid a
gold on the green, and the warm south-wind
gently rocked the daisies, and the
lark&#8217;s song was like a silvery water-fall up
in the sky.</p>
<p>But they were young; and, oh, the rich
significance of the word &#8220;young&#8221; when the
heart is young as well as the body, when
the thoughts are not doubts, and when the
eyes look not backward, but only forward,
into a bright future!</p>

</div>
<p>During thirty years of the first half of
this century Mrs. St. Alban&#8217;s finishing
school for young gentlewomen was a
famous institution of its kind. For she
had been born to the manner of courts
and of people of high degree; and when
evil fortune met her, she very wisely
turned her inherited social advantages into
a means of honest livelihood. Aspatria
was much impressed by her noble bearing
and fine manners, and by the elaborate
state in which the twelve pupils, of whom
she was one, lived.</p>
<p>Each had her own suite of apartments;
each was expected to keep a maid, and to
dress with the utmost care and propriety.
There were fine horses in the stables for
their equestrian exercise, there were grooms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
to attend them during it, and there were
regular reception-days, which afforded
tyros in social accomplishments practical
opportunities for cultivating the graceful
and gracious urbanity which evidences
really fine breeding.</p>
<p>Many of Aspatria&#8217;s companions were of
high rank,&mdash;Lady Julias and Lady Augustas,
who were destined to wear ducal
coronets and to stand around the throne
of their young queen. But they were
always charmingly pleasant and polite,
and Aspatria soon acquired their outward
form of calm deliberation and their mode
of low, soft speech. For the rest, she
decided, with singular prudence, to cultivate
only those talents which nature had
obviously granted her.</p>
<p>A few efforts proved that she had no
taste for art. Indeed, the attempt to portray
the majesty of the mountains or the
immensity of the ocean seemed to her
childishly petty and futile. She had dwelt
among the high places and been familiar
with the great sea, and to make images of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
them appeared a kind of sacrilege. But
she liked the study of languages, and she
had a rich contralto voice capable of expressing
all the emotions of the heart. At
the piano she hesitated; its music, under
her unskilled fingers, sounded mechanical;
she doubted her ability to put a soul into
that instrument. But the harp was different;
its strings held sympathetic tones she
felt competent to master. To these studies
she added a course of English literature
and dancing. She was already a fine
rider, and her information obtained from
the vicar&#8217;s library and the Encyclopædia
covered an enormous variety of subjects,
though it was desultory, and in many
respects imperfect.</p>
<p>Her new life was delightful to her. She
had an innate love for study, for quiet, and
for elegant surroundings. These tastes
were fully gratified. The large house stood
in a fair garden, surrounded by very high
walls, with entrance-gates of handsomely
wrought iron. Perfect quiet reigned within
this flowery enclosure. She could study
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
without the constant interruptions which
had annoyed her at home; and she was
wisely aided in her studies by masters
whose low
voices and gliding
steps seemed only to accentuate the
peace of the wide schoolroom,
with its perfect appointments
and its placid group of
beautiful students.</p>

<br />
</div>
<p>On Saturdays Brune generally
spent several hours
with her; and if the weather
were fine, they rode or walked in the Park.
Brune was a constant wonder to Aspatria.
Certainly his handsome uniform had done
much for him, but there was a greater
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
change than could be effected by mere
clothes. Without losing that freshness and
singleness of mind he owed to his country
training, he had become a man of fashion,
a little of a dandy, a very innocent sort of
a lady-killer. His arrival caused always a
faint flutter in Mrs. St. Alban&#8217;s dove-cot,
and the noble damosels found many little
womanly devices to excuse their passing
through the parlour while Brune was present.
They liked to see him bend his
beautiful head to them; and Lady Mary
Boleyn, who was Aspatria&#8217;s friend and
companion, was mildly envied the privileges
this relation gave her.</p>
<p>During the vacations Aspatria was always
the guest of one or other of her
mates, though generally she spent them
at the splendid seat of the Boleyns in
Hampshire, and the unconscious education
thus received was of the greatest value to
her. It gave the ease of nature to acquired
accomplishments, and, above all,
that air which we call distinction, which is
rarely natural, and is attained only by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
frequent association with those who dwell
on the highest social peaks.</p>
<p>Much might be said of this phase of
Aspatria&#8217;s life which may be left to the
reader&#8217;s imagination. For three years it
saw only such changes as advancing intelligence
and growing friendships made.
The real change was in Aspatria personally.
No one could have traced without
constant doubt the slim, virginal, unfinished-looking
girl that left Seat-Ambar,
in the womanly perfection of Aspatria
aged twenty-four years. She had grown
several inches taller; her angles had all disappeared;
every joint was softly rounded.
Her hands and arms were exquisite; her
throat and the poise of her head like those
of a Greek goddess. Her hair was darker
and more abundant, and her eyes retained
all their old charm, with some rarer and
nobler addition.</p>
<p>To be sure, she had not the perfect regularity
of feature that distinguished some
of her associates, that exact beauty which
Titian&#8217;s Venus possesses, and which makes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
no man&#8217;s heart beat a throb the faster.
Her face had rather the mobile irregularity
of Leonardo&#8217;s Mona Lisa, the charming
face that men love passionately, the face
that men can die for.</p>
<p>At the close of the third year she refused
all invitations for the summer holidays,
and went back to Seat-Ambar.
There had not been much communication
between Will and herself. He was occupied
with his land and his sheep, his wife
and his two babies. People then took
each other&#8217;s affection as a matter of course,
without the daily assurance of it. About
twice a year Will had sent her a few
strong words of love, and a bare description
of any change about the home, or
else Alice had covered a sheet with pretty
nothings, written in the small, pointed,
flowing characters then fashionable.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_36' id='linki_36'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0191.jpg' alt='' title='' width='505' height='256' />
<br />
</div>
<p>But the love of Aspatria for her home
depended on no such trivial, accidental
tokens. It was in her blood; her personality
was knotted to Seat-Ambar by centuries
of inherited affection; she could test
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
it by the fact that it would have killed her
to see it pass into a stranger&#8217;s hands. When
once she had turned her face northward,
it seemed impossible to travel quickly
enough. Hundreds of miles away she
felt the cool wind blowing through the
garden, and the scent of the damask rose
was on it. She heard the gurgling of
the becks and the wayside streams, and the
whistling of the boys in the barn, and the
tinkling of the sheep-bells on the highest
fells. The raspberries were ripe in their
sunny corner; she tasted them afar off.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
The dark oak rooms, their perfume of
ancient things, their air of homelike comfort,&mdash;it
was all so vivid, so present to her
memory, that her heart beat and thrilled,
as the breast of a nursing mother thrills
and beats for her longing babe.</p>
<p>She had told no one she was coming;
for, the determination made, she knew
that she would reach home before the
Dalton postman got the letter to Seat-Ambar.
The gig she had hired she left
at the lower garden gate; and then she
walked quickly through the rose-alley up
to the front door. It stood open, and
she heard a baby crying. How strange
the wailing notes sounded! She went
forward, and opened the parlour door;
Alice was washing the child, and she
turned with an annoyed look to see the
intruder.</p>
<p>Of course the expression changed, but
not quickly enough to prevent Aspatria
seeing that her visit was inopportune.
Alice said afterward that she did not recognize
her sister-in-law, and, as Will met her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
precisely as he would have met an entire
stranger, Alice&#8217;s excuse was doubtless a
valid one. There were abundant exclamations
and rejoicings when her identity was
established, but Will could do nothing all
the evening but wonder over the changes
that had taken place in his sister.</p>
<p>However, when the first joy of reunion
is over, it is a prudent thing not to try too
far the welcome that is given to the home-comer
who has once left home. Will and
Alice had grown to the idea that Aspatria
would never return to claim the room
in Seat-Ambar which was hers legally so
long as she lived. It had been refurnished
and was used as a guest-room. Aspatria
looked with dismay on the changes made.
Her very sampler had been sent away,&mdash;the
bit of canvas made sacred by her
mother&#8217;s fingers holding her own over it.
She could remember the instances connected
with the formation of almost every
letter of its simple prayer,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Jesus, permit thy gracious name to stand</p>
<p>As the first effort of my infant hand;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>And, as my fingers on the sampler move,</p>
<p>Engage my tender heart to seek thy love.</p>
<p>With thy dear children may I have a part,</p>
<p>And write thy Name, thyself, upon my heart.</p>
</div></div>
<p>And it was gone! She went into the
lumber-room, and picked it out from under
a pile of old prints and shabbily framed
certificates for prize cattle.</p>
<p>With a sad heart Aspatria regarded the
other changes. Her little tent-bed, with
its white dimity curtains, had been given
to baby&#8217;s nurse. The vase her father had
bought her at Kendal fair was broken.
Her small mirror and dressing-table had
been removed for a fine Psyche in a
gilded frame. Nothing, nothing was untouched,
but the big dower-chest into
which she had flung her wretched wedding-clothes.
She stood silently before it,
reflecting, with excusable ill-nature, that
neither Will nor Alice knew the secret of
its spring. Her mother had taught it to
her, and that bit of knowledge she determined
to keep to herself.</p>

<img src='images/img_0195.jpg' alt='' title='' width='477' height='400' />
<br />
</div>
<p>After some hesitation she tried the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
spring: it answered her pressure at once;
the lid flew back, and there lay the unhappy
white satin dress, the wreath, and
veil, and slippers, just as she had tumbled
them in. The bitter hour came sharply
back to her; she thought and gazed, and
thought and gazed, until she felt herself
to be weeping. Then she softly closed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
the lid, and, as she did so, a smile parted
her lips,&mdash;a smile that denied all that her
tears said; a smile of hope, of good presage,
of coming happiness.</p>
<p>She stayed only a week at Seat-Ambar,
though she had originally intended to
remain until the harvest was over. The
time was spent in public festivity; every
one in Allerdale was invited to give her a
fitting welcome. But the very formality
of all this entertainment pained her. It
was, after all, only a cruel evidence that
Will and Alice did not care to take her into
their real home-life. She would rather
have sat alone with them, and talked of
their hopes and plans, and been permitted
to make friends of the babies.</p>
<p>So far away, so far away as she had
drifted in three years from the absent living!
Would the dead be kinder? She
went to Aspatria Church and sat down in
her mother&#8217;s seat, and let the strange spiritual
atmosphere which hovers in old
churches fill her heart with its supernatural
influence. All around her were the graves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
of her
fore-elders,
strong elemental
men, simple
God-loving women.
Did they know her?
Did they care for her?
Her soul looked with
piteous entreaty into the void behind it,
but there was no answer; only that dreadful
silence of the dead, which presses upon
the drum of the ear like thunder.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_38' id='linki_38'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0197.jpg' alt='' title='' width='422' height='493' />
<br />
</div>
<p>She went into the quiet yard around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
church. The ancient, ancient sun shone
on the young grass. Over her mother&#8217;s
grave the sweet thyme had grown luxuriantly.
She rubbed her hands in it, and
spread them toward heaven with a prayer.
Then peace came into her heart, and she
felt as if eyes, unseen heavenly eyes,
rained happy influence upon her. Thus
it is that death imparts to life its most
intense interest; for, kneeling in his very
presence, Aspatria forgot the mortality of
her parents, and did reverence to that
within them which was eternal.</p>
<p>She returned to London, and was a little
disappointed there also. Mrs. St. Alban
had promised herself an absolute release
from any outside element. She felt Aspatria
a trifle in the way, and, though far
too polite to show her annoyance, Aspatria
by some similar instinct divined it.
That is the way always. When we plan
for ourselves, all our plans fail. Happy
are they who learn early to let fate alone,
and never interfere with the Powers who
hold the thread of their destiny!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>It was not until she had reached this
mood, a kind of content indifference, that
her good genius could work for her. She
then sent Brune as her messenger, and
Brune took his sister to meet her on Richmond
Hill. On their way thither they
talked about Seat-Ambar, and Will and
Alice, until Aspatria suddenly noticed that
Brune was not listening to her. His eyes
were fixed upon a lovely woman approaching
them. It was Sarah Sandys. Brune
stood bareheaded to receive her salutation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never should have known you, Lieutenant
Anneys,&#8221; she said, extending her
hand, and beaming like sunshine on the
handsome officer, &#8220;had not your colonel
Jardine been in Richmond to-day. He is
very proud of you, sir, and said so many
fine things of you that I am ambitious to
show him that we are old acquaintances.
May I know, through you, Mrs. Anneys
also?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my sister, Mrs. Sandys,&mdash;my
sister&mdash;&#8221; Brune hesitated a moment, and
then said firmly, &#8220;Miss Anneys.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>Then Sarah insisted on taking them to
her house to lunch; and there she soon
had them under her influence. She waited
on them with ravishing smiles and all sorts
of pretty offices. She took them in her
handsome carriage to drive, she insisted
on their remaining to dinner. And before
the drive was over, she had induced Aspatria
to extend her visit until the opening
of Mrs. St. Alban&#8217;s school.</p>
<p>&#8220;We three are from the north country,&#8221;
she said, with an air of relationship; &#8220;and
how absurd for Miss Anneys to be alone at
Mrs. St. Alban&#8217;s, where she is not wanted,
and for me to be alone here, when I desire
her society so much!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aspatria was much pleased to receive
such a delightful invitation, and a messenger
was sent at once for her maid. Mrs.
St. Alban was quite ready to resign Aspatria,
and the maid was as glad as her mistress
to leave the lonely mansion. In an
hour or two she had removed Aspatria&#8217;s
wardrobe, and was arranging the pleasant
rooms Mrs. Sandys had placed at her
guest&#8217;s disposal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>Sarah was evidently bent on conquest.
Her toilet was a marvellous combination
of some shining blue and white texture,
mingled with pink roses and gold ornaments.
Her soft fair
hair was loosened
and curled, and she
had a childlike manner
of being carelessly
happy. Brune
sat at her right hand;
she talked to him in
smiles and glances,
and gave her words
to Aspatria. She
was determined to
please both sister
and brother, and she
succeeded. Aspatria
thought she had
never in all her life seen a woman so lovable,
so amusing, so individual.</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:241px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_39' id='linki_39'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0201.jpg' alt='' title='' width='241' height='391' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>Brune was naturally</span> shy and silent
among women. Sarah made him eloquent,
because she had the tact to discover
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
the subject on which he could talk,&mdash;his
regiment, and its sayings and doings.
So Brune was delighted with himself; he
had never before suspected how clever he
was. Stimulated by Sarah&#8217;s and Aspatria&#8217;s
laughter and curiosity, he found it
easy to retail funny little bits of palace and
mess gossip, and to describe the queer
men and the vain men and the fine fellows
that were his familiars.</p>
<p>&#8220;And pray how do you amuse yourself,
Lieutenant? Do you drink wine, and
gamble, and go to the races, and bet your
purse empty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was never brought up in such ways,&#8221;
Brune answered, &#8220;and, I can tell you, I
wouldn&#8217;t make believe to like them.
There are a good many dalesmen in my
company, and none of us enjoy anything
more than a fair throw or an in-lock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A throw or an in-lock! What do you
mean, Lieutenant? You must explain
yourself to Miss Anneys and myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aspatria knows well enough. Did
you ever see north-country lads wrestling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
madam? No? Then you have as fine a
thing in keeping for your eyes as human
creatures can show you. I&#8217;ll warrant that!
Why-a! wrestling brings all men to their
level. When Colonel Jardine is ugly-tempered,
and top-heavy with his authority, a
few sound throws over Timothy Sutcliffe&#8217;s
head does bring him to level very well. I
had a little in-play with him yesterday;
for in the wrestling-ring we be all equals,
though out of it he is my colonel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the in-play. Tell me about
it, for I see Miss Anneys is not at all
interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Jardine is a fine wrestler; a
fair match he would be even for brother
Will. Yesterday he said he could throw
me; and I took the challenge willingly.
So we shook hands, and went squarely for
the throw. I was in good luck, and soon
got my head under his right arm, and his
head close down to my left side. Then it
was only to get my right arm up to his
shoulder, and lift him as high as my head,
and, when so, lean backward and throw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
him over my head: we call it the Flying
Horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can see it very well. No wonder
Rosalind fell in love with Orlando when
he threw the wrestler Charles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were they north-country or Cornish
men?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was far too kindly and polite to
smile; indeed, she gave Aspatria a pretty,
imperative glance, and answered, in the
most natural manner, &#8220;I think they were
Italians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Brune, with some contempt.
&#8220;Chaff on their ways! The Devonshire
wrestlers are brutal; the Cornish are too
slow; but the Cumberland men wrestle
like gentlemen. They meet square and
level in the ring, and the one who could
carry ill-will for a fair throw would very
soon find himself out of all rings and all
good fellowship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said &#8216;even brother Will.&#8217; Is your
brother a better wrestler than you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My song! he is that! Will has his
match, though. We had a ploughman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
once,&mdash;Aspatria remembers him,&mdash;Robert
Steadman, an upright, muscular young
fellow, civil and respectful as could be in
everything about his work and place; but
on wet days when we were all, masters and
servants, in the barn together, it was a
sight to see Robert wrestling with Will for
the mastery, and Will never so ready to
say, &#8216;Well done!&#8217; nor the rest of us so
happy, as when we saw Will&#8217;s two brawny
legs going handsomely over Robert&#8217;s
head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were a man, I should try to be a
fine wrestler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great comfort,&#8221; said Brune.
&#8220;If you have a quarrel of any kind, it is a
deal more satisfactory to meet your man,
and throw him a few times over your head,
than to go to law with him. It puts a
stop to unpleasantness very quickly and
very good-naturedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Sarah rose and opened the piano,
and from its keys dashed out a lilting,
hurrying melody, like the galloping of
horses and shaking of bridles; and in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
few moments she began to sing, and Brune
went to her side, and, because she looked
so steadily into his eyes, he could remember
nothing at all of the song but its
dashing refrain,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>&#8220;For he whom I wed</p>
<p class='indent4'>Must be north country bred,</p>
<p>And must carry me back to the North Countrie.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Then Aspatria played some wonderful
music on her harp, and Sarah and Brune
sat still and listened to their own hearts,
and sent out shy glances, and caught
each other in the act, and Brune was
made nervous, and Sarah gay, by the
circumstance.</p>
<p>By and by they began to talk of schools,
and of how much Aspatria had learned;
and so Brune regretted his own ignorance,
and wished he had been more attentive to
his schoolmaster.</p>
<p>Sarah laughed at the wish. &#8220;A knowledge
of Shakspeare and the musical
glasses and the Della Cruscans,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;is for foolish, sentimental women. You
can wrestle, and you can fight, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
suppose you can make money, and perhaps
even make love. Is there anything
else a soldier needs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Jardine is very clever,&#8221; continued
Brune, regretfully; &#8220;and I had a
good schoolmaster&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Lieutenant!&#8221; said Sarah.
&#8220;None of them are good. They all spoil
your eyes, and seek to lay a curse on you;
that is the confusion of languages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I might have learned Latin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the speech of pagans and
infidels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or logic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Logic hath nothing to say in a good
cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or philosophy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Philosophy is curiosity. Socrates was
very properly put to death for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were all laughing together, when
Sarah condemned Socrates, and the evening
passed like a happy dream away.</p>
<p>It was succeeded by weeks of the same
delight. Aspatria soon learned to love
Sarah. She had never before had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
woman friend on whom she could rely
and to whom she could open her heart.
Sarah induced her to speak of Ulfar, to
tell her all her suffering and her plans and
hopes, and she gave her in return a true
affection and a most sincere sympathy.
Nothing of the past that referred to Ulfar
was left untold; and as the two women sat
together during the long summer days,
they grew very near to each other, and
there was but one mind and one desire
between them.</p>
<p>So that when the time came for Aspatria
to go back to Mrs. St. Alban&#8217;s, Sarah
would not hear of their separation. &#8220;You
have had enough of book-learning,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Remain with me. We will go to
Paris, to Rome, to Vienna. We will study
through travel and society. It is by rubbing
yourself against all kinds of men and
women that you acquire the finest polish
of life; and then when Ulfar comes back
you will be able to meet him upon all
civilized grounds. And as for the South
Americans, we will buy all the books
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
about them we can find. Are they red
or white or black, I wonder? Are they
pagans or Christians? I seem to remember
that when I was at school I
learned that the Peruvians worshipped
the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Sarah, that they are all descendants
of Spaniards; so they must be
Roman Catholics. And I have read that
their women are beautiful and witty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Aspatria, nothing goes with
Spaniards but gravity and green olives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aspatria was easily persuaded to accept
Sarah&#8217;s offer; she was indeed very happy
in the prospect before her. But Brune was
miserable. He had spent a rapturous
summer, and it was to end without harvest,
or the promise thereof. He could
not endure the prospect, and one night he
made a movement so decided that Sarah
was compelled to set him back a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you ever in love, Mrs. Sandys?&#8221;
poor Brune asked, with his heart filling his
mouth.</p>
<p>She looked thoughtfully at him a moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
and then slowly answered: &#8220;I once
felt myself in danger, and I fled to France.
I consider it the finest action of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aspatria felt sorry for her brother, and
she said warmly: &#8220;I think no one falls in
love now. Love is out of date.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah enjoyed her temper. &#8220;You are
right, dear,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Culture
makes love a conscious operation. When
women are all feeling, they fall in love;
when they have intellect and will, they
attach themselves only after a critical
examination of the object.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, when they were alone, Aspatria
took her friend to task for her cruelty:
&#8220;You know Brune loves you, Sarah; and
you do love him. Why make him miserable?
Has he presumed too far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed! He is as adoring and
humble as one could wish a future lord
and master to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give our love time to grow.
When we come back, if Brune has been
true to me in every way, he may fall to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
blessing himself with both hands;&#8221; and
then she began to sing,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Betide, betide, whatever betide,</p>
<p>Love shall be Lord of Sandy-Side!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;Love is a burden two hearts carry very
easily together, but, oh, Sarah! I know
how hard it is to bear it alone. Therefore
I say, be kind to Brune while you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, your idea is a very pretty
one. I read the other day a Hindu
version of it that smelled charmingly of
the soil,&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;A clapping is not made with one hand alone:</p>
<p>Your love, my beloved, must answer my own.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>But in spite of such reflections, Sarah&#8217;s
will and intellect were predominant, and
she left poor Brune with only such hope
as he could glean from the lingering pressure
of her hand and the tears in her
eyes. Aspatria&#8217;s pleading had done no
good. Perhaps it had done harm; for the
very nature of love is that it should be
spontaneous.</p>

</div>
<p>One morning in spring Aspatria stood
in a balcony overlooking the principal
thoroughfare of Rome,&mdash;the Rome of papal
government, mythical, mystical, mediæval
in its character. A procession of friars
had just passed; a handsome boy was crying
violets; some musical puppets were
performing in the shadow of the opposite
palace; a party of brigands were going to
the Angelo prison; the spirit of Cæsar was
still abroad in the black-browed men and
women, lounging and laughing in their
gaudy, picturesque costumes; and the spirit
of ecclesiasticism lifted itself above every
earthly object, and touched proudly the
bells of a thousand churches. Aspatria
was weary of all.</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:287px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_40' id='linki_40'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0213.jpg' alt='' title='' width='287' height='470' />
<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>She had that</span> morning an imperative
nostalgia. She could see nothing but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
mountains of Cumberland, and the white
sheep wandering about their green sides.
Through the church-bells
she heard the
sheep-bells.
Above the boy
crying violets
she heard the
boy whistling
in the fresh-ploughed
furrow.
As for the violets,
she knew
how the wild
ones were blowing
in Ambar
wood, and how
in the garden the
daffodil-beds were aglow,
and the sweet thyme humbling
itself at their feet, because
each bore a chalice. Oh for a
breath from the mountains and the sea!
The hot Roman streets, with their ever-changing
human elements of sorrow and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
mirth, sin and prayer, riches and poverty,
made her sad and weary.</p>
<p>Sarah came toward her with a letter in
her hand. &#8220;Ria,&#8221; she said, &#8220;this is from
Lady Redware. Your husband will be in
England very shortly.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the first time Sarah had ever
called Ulfar Aspatria&#8217;s husband. In conversation
the two women had always
spoken of him as &#8220;Ulfar.&#8221; The change
was significant. It implied that Sarah
thought the time had come for Aspatria
to act decisively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted to go back to
England. We have been twenty months
away, Sarah. I was just feeling as if it
were twenty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah looked critically at the woman
who was going to cast her last die for love.
She was so entirely different from the girl
who had first won that love, how was it
possible for her to recapture the same
sweet, faithless emotion? She had a swift
memory of the slim girl in the plain black
frock whom she had seen sitting under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
whin-bushes. And then she glanced at
Aspatria standing under the blue-and-red
awning of the Roman palace. She was
now twenty-six years old, and in the very
glory of her womanhood, tall, superbly
formed, graceful, calm, and benignant.
Her face was luminous with intellect and
feeling, her manner that of a woman high-bred
and familiar with the world. Culture
had done all for her that the lapidary does
for the diamond; travel and social advantages
had added to the gem a golden setting.
She was so little like the sorrowful
child whom Ulfar had last seen in the
vicar&#8217;s meadow that Sarah felt instantaneous
recognition to be almost impossible.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Aspatria agreed
to accept Sarah&#8217;s plan and wait in Richmond
the development of events. At first
she had been strongly in favour of a
return to Seat-Ambar. &#8220;If Ulfar really
wants to see me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he will be
most likely to seek me there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But then, Ria, he may think he does
not want to see you. Men never know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
what they really do want. You have to
give them &#8216;leadings.&#8217; If Ulfar can look on
you now and have no curiosity about your
identity, I should say the man was not
worth a speculation from any point. See
if you have hold sufficient on his memory
to pique his curiosity. If you have, lead
him wherever you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how? And where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I carry a divining-cup, Ria? Can
I foresee the probabilities of a man so impossible
as Ulfar Fenwick? I only know
that Richmond is a good place to watch
events from.&#8221;</p>
<p>And of course the Richmond house
suited Brune. His love had grown to the
utmost of Sarah&#8217;s expectations, and he was
no longer to be put off with smiles and
pleasant words. Sarah had promised him
an answer when she returned, and he
claimed it with a passionate persistence
that had finally something imperative in it.
To this mood Sarah succumbed; though
she declared that Brune had chosen the
morning of all others most inconvenient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
for her. She was just leaving the house.
She was going to London about her
jewels. Brune had arrested the coachman
by a peremptory movement, and he looked
as if he were quite prepared to lift Sarah
out of the carriage.</p>
<p>So Aspatria went alone. She was glad
of the swift movement in the fresh air, she
was glad that she could be quiet and let
it blow passively upon her. The restlessness
of watching had made her feverish.
She had the &#8220;strait&#8221; of a strong mind
which longs to meet her destiny. For her
love for her husband had grown steadily
with her efforts to be worthy of that love,
and she longed to meet him face to face
and try the power of her personality over
him. The trial did not frighten her; she
felt within her the ability to accomplish
it; her feet were on a level with her task;
she was the height of a woman above
it.</p>
<p>Musing on this subject, letting her mind
shoot to and fro like a shuttle between the
past and the present, she reached Piccadilly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
and entered a large jeweller&#8217;s shop.
The proprietor was talking to a gentleman
who was exhibiting a number of uncut
gems. Aspatria knew him instantly. It
was Ulfar Fenwick,&mdash;the same Ulfar, older,
and yet distinctly handsomer. For the
dark hair slightly whitened, and the thin,
worn cheeks, had an intensely human
aspect. She saw that he had suffered;
that the sum of life was on his face,&mdash;toil,
difficulty, endurance, mind, and also that
pathetic sadness which tells of endurance
without avail.</p>
<p>She went to the extreme end of the
counter, and began to examine the jewels
which Sarah had sent to be reset. Some
were finished; others were waiting for the
selection of a particular style, and Aspatria
looked critically at the models shown her.
The occupation gave her an opportunity
to calm and consider herself; she could
look at the jewels a few moments without
expressing an opinion.</p>
<p>Then she gave, in a clear, distinct voice,
some order regarding a pearl necklace;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
and Ulfar turned like a flash, and looked
at the woman who had spoken. She had
the pearls in one hand; the other touched
a satin cushion on which lay many ornaments
of diamonds, sapphires, and rubies.
The moonlight iridescence of the pearls,
the sparkling glory of the gems, seemed
to be a part of her noble beauty. He
forgot his own treasures, and stood looking
at the woman whose voice had called
to him out of the past, had penetrated his
heart like a bell struck sharply in its innermost
room. Who was it? Where had
they met before? He knew the face. He
knew, and yet he did not know, the whole
charming personality. As she turned,
his eyes met her eyes, and the pure pallor
of her cheeks was flooded with crimson.</p>
<p>She passed him within touch; the rustle
of her garments, their faint perfume, the
simple sense of her nearness, thrilled his
being wondrously. And, above all, that
sense of familiarity! What could it mean?
He gave the stones into the jeweller&#8217;s care,
and hurriedly followed her steps.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That is Sarah Sandys&#8217;s carriage, my
barony for it!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;and the
men are in the Sandys livery. Sarah,
then, is in Richmond; and the woman
who rides in her carriage is very likely in
her house; but who can it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>The face haunted him, the voice tormented
him like a melody that we continually
try to catch. He endeavoured to
place both as he rode out to Richmond.
More than once the thought of Aspatria
came to him, but he could not make any
memory of her fit that splendid vision of
the woman with uplifted hand and the
string of pearls dropping from it. Her
exquisite face, between the beauty of their
reflection and the flashing of the gems
beneath, retained in his memory a kind
of glory. &#8220;Such loveliness is the proper
setting for pearls and diamonds,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Many a beauty I have seen, but none
that can touch the heel of her shoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>For he really thought that it was her
personal charms which had so moved him.
It was the sense of familiarity; it was in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
far deeper and dimmer way a presentiment
of right, of possession, a feeling of personal
touch in the emotion, which perplexed
and stimulated him
as the mere mystery and
beauty of the
flesh could
never have
done.</p>
<div class='figright' style='width:348px'>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>As soon as</span> he
reached the top of
Richmond Hill he
saw Sarah. She was
sauntering along
that loveliest of
cliffs, with Brune. An
orderly was leading
Brune&#8217;s horse; he himself
was in the first ecstasy of
Sarah&#8217;s acknowledged love. Ulfar went
into the Star and Garter Inn and watched
Sarah. He had no claim upon her, and
yet he felt as if she had been false to him.
&#8220;And for a mere soldier!&#8221; Then he
looked critically at the soldier, and said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
with some contempt: &#8220;I am sorry for him!
Sarah Sandys will have her pastime, and
then say, &#8216;Farewell, good sir!&#8217;&#8221; As for
the mere soldier being Brune Anneys,
that was a thought out of Ulfar&#8217;s horizon.</p>
<p>In a couple of hours he went to
Sarah&#8217;s. She met him with real delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are just five years lovelier, Sarah,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Admiration from Sir Ulfar Fenwick is
admiration indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I say you are beautiful, though
I have just seen the most bewitching woman
that ever blessed my eyes,&mdash;in your
carriage too.&#8221; And then, swift as light
or thought, there flashed across his mind
a conviction that the Beauty and Aspatria
were identical. It was a momentary intelligence;
he grasped it merely as a clew
that might lead him somewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my carriage? I dare say it was
Ria. She went to Piccadilly this morning
about some jewels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She reminded me of Aspatria.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you brought back with you that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
old trouble? I have no mind to hear
more of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the lady I saw this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is the sister of the man I am going
to marry. In four months she will be
my sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is her name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is to tell you my secret, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you throwing your enchantments
over some soldier. I knew just how the
poor fellow felt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you also have been in Arcadia.
Be thankful for your past blessings. I do
not expect you to rejoice with me; none
of the apostolic precepts are so hard as
that which bids us rejoice with those who
do rejoice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither Elizabeth nor you have ever
named Aspatria in your letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you expect us to change guard
over Ambar-Side? I dare say Aspatria
has grown into a buxom, rosy-cheeked
woman and quite forgotten you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go and see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you ought. Also, you should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
give her her freedom. I consider your
behaviour a dog-in-the-manger atrocity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you not pick nicer words, Sarah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not if I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah, tell me truly, have I lost my
good looks?&#8221;</p>
<p>She regarded him attentively a moment,
and answered: &#8220;Not quite. You have
some good points yet. You have grown
thin and gray, and lost something, and
perhaps gained something; but you are
not very old, and then, you know, you
have your title, and your castle, and your
very old, old family, and I suppose a good
deal of money.&#8221; In reality, she was sure
that he had never before been so attractive;
for he had now the magic of a
countenance informed by intellect and
experience, eyes brimming with light, lips
neither loose nor coarse, yet full of passion
and the faculty of enjoyment.</p>
<p>He smiled grimly at Sarah&#8217;s list of his
charms, and said, &#8220;When will you introduce
me to your future sister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This evening. Come about nine. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
have a few sober people who will be
delighted to hear your South American
adventures. Ria goes to Lady Chester&#8217;s
ball soon after nine. Do not miss your
chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I see her now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose she would leave a
<i>modiste</i> for&mdash;you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where Aspatria is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah, who is the young lady I saw in
your carriage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is the sister of the officer you saw
me with, the man I am going to marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you meet him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At a friend&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you meet her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her brother brought her to my house.
I asked her to stay with me, and finally we
went to Italy together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a very aristocratic manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She ought to have. She was educated
at Mrs. St. Alban&#8217;s, and she visits at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Earl of Arundel&#8217;s, the Duke of Norfolk&#8217;s,
and the very exclusive Boleyns&#8217;,&mdash;Lady
Mary Boleyn is her friend, and she has
also had the great advantage of my society
for nearly two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then of course she is not Aspatria,
and my heart is a liar, and my memory is
a traitor, and my eyes do not see correctly.
I will call about nine. I am at the Star
and Garter. If she should name me at
all&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you imagine she noticed you? and
in such a public place as Howell&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really do imagine she noticed me.
Ask her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are in love again. After all
that experience has done for you! It is a
Nemesis, Ulfar. I have often noticed that,
however faithless a man may be, there
comes at last one woman who avenges
all the rest. Enter Nemesis at nine
to-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah, you are an angel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Ulfar. I thought you
classed me with the other side.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>&#8220;As for Aspatria&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is too short to discuss Aspatria.
I remember one day at Redware being
sharply requested to keep silence on that
subject. The wheel of retribution has
made a perfect circle as regards Aspatria!
I shall certainly tell Ria that you have
made her the heroine of your disagreeable
matrimonial romance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Sarah! Do not say a word
to her. I must wait until nine, I suppose?
And I am so anxious and so fearful,
Sarah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must wait until nine. And as for
the rest, I know very well that in the present
age a lover&#8217;s cares and fears have</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>Dwindled to the smallest span.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Do go to your hotel, and get clothed and
in your right mind. You are most unbecomingly
dressed. Good-by, old friend,
good-by!&#8221; And she left him with an
elaborate courtesy.</p>
<p>Ulfar was now in a vortex. Things
went around and around in his consciousness;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
and whenever he endeavoured to
examine events with his reason, then feeling
advanced some unsupported conviction,
and threw him back into the same senseless
whirl of emotion.</p>
<div class='figleft' style='width:219px'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_42' id='linki_42'></a>

<br />
</div>
<p><span class='nowrap'>He had failed</span> to catch
the point which would
have given him the clew
to the whole mystery,&mdash;the
identity of Brune
with the splendidly accoutred
officer Sarah
avowed to be her intended
husband.
Without taking special
note of him, Ulfar had
seen certain signs of birth,
breeding, and assured
position. In his mind
there was a great gulf
between the haughty-looking
soldier and
the simple, handsome, but rather boorish-looking
young Squire of Ambar-Side.
The two individualities were as far apart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
in social claims as the north and south
poles are apart physically.</p>
<p>And if this beautiful woman were indeed
Aspatria, how could he reconcile the fact
with her education at St. Alban&#8217;s, her
friendship with such exalted families, her
relationship to an officer of evident birth
and position? When he thought thus, he
acknowledged the impossibility; but then
no sooner had he acknowledged it than his
heart passionately denied the deduction,
with the simple iteration, &#8220;It is Aspatria!
It is Aspatria!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aspatria or not, he told himself that he
was at last genuinely in love. Every affair
before was tame, pale, uninteresting. If
it was not Aspatria, then the first Aspatria
was the shadow of the second and real one;
the preface to love&#8217;s glorious tale; the prelude
to his song; the gray, sweet dawn to
his perfect day. He could not eat, nor sit
still, nor think reasonably, nor yet stop
thinking. The sun stood still; the minutes
were hours; at four o&#8217;clock he wished to
fling the timepiece out of the window.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>Aspatria had the immense strength of
certainty. She knew. Also, she had
Sarah to advise with. Still better, she
had the conviction that Ulfar loved her.
Perhaps Sarah had exaggerated Ulfar&#8217;s
desperate condition; if so, she had done
it consciously, for she knew that as soon
as a woman is sure of her power she puts
on an authority which commands it.
She was now only afraid that Ulfar would
not be kept in suspense long enough,
that Aspatria would forgive him too
easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do make yourself as puzzling as you
can, for this one night, Aspatria,&#8221; she
urged. &#8220;Try to outvie and outdo and
even affront that dove-like simplicity he
used to adore in you, and into which you
are still apt to relapse. He told me once
that you looked like a Quakeress when he
first saw you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just home from Miss Gilpin&#8217;s
school in Kendal. It was a Quaker school.
I have always kept a black gown ready,
like the one he saw me first in.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No black gown to-night. I have a
mind to stay here and see that you turn
the Quakeress into a princess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do all you wish. To-night you
shall have your way; but poor Ulfar must
have suffered, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Ulfar, indeed! Be merry; that
is the best armour against love. What
ruins women? Revery and sentimentality.
A woman who does not laugh ought to
be watched.&#8221;</p>
<p>But though she lectured and advised
Aspatria as to the ways of men and the
ways of love, Sarah had not much faith in
her own counsels. &#8220;No one can draw
out a programme for a woman&#8217;s happiness,&#8221;
she mused; &#8220;she will not keep to
its lines. Now, I do wonder whether she
will dress gorgeously or not? What did
Solomon in all his glory wear? If Aspatria
only knew how dress catches a man&#8217;s
eye, and then touches his vanity, and then
sets fire to his imagination, and finally,
somehow, someway, gets to his heart! If
she only knew,&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;All thoughts, all passions, all delights,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Whatever stirs this mortal frame,</p>
<p>Are but the ministers of Love,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And feed his sacred flame!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>A little before nine, Ulfar entered Sarah&#8217;s
drawing-room. It was lighted with wax
candles. It was sweet with fresh violets,
and at the farther end Aspatria stood by
her harp. She was dressed for Lady
Chester&#8217;s ball, and was waiting her chaperon;
but there had been a little rebellion
against her leaving without giving her
admirers one song. Every person was
suggesting his or her favourite; and she
stood smiling, uncertain, listening, watching,
for one voice and face.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_43' id='linki_43'></a>
</div>
<img src='images/img_0233.jpg' alt='' title='' width='434' height='529' />
<br />
</div>
<p>Her dazzling bodice was clasped with
emeralds; her draperies were of damasked
gauze, shot with gold and silver, and
abloom with flowers. Her fair neck sparkled
with diamonds; and the long white
fingers which touched the strings so firmly
glinted with flashing gems. The moment
Ulfar entered, she saw him. His eyes, full
of fiery prescience, forced her to meet their
inquiry; and then it was that she sat down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
and filled the room with tinkling notes,
that made every one remember the mountains,
and the merry racing of the spring
winds, and the trickling of half-hidden
fountains.</p>
<p>Sarah advanced with him. She touched
Aspatria slightly, and said: &#8220;Hush! a
moment. This is my friend Sir Ulfar
Fenwick, Ria.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ria lifted her eyes sweetly to his eyes;
she bowed with the grace and benignity of
a queen, and adroitly avoided speech by
turning the melody into song:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;I never shall forget</p>
<p>The mountain maid that once I met</p>
<p>By the cold river&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>I met her on the mountain-side;</p>
<p>She watched her herds unnoticed there:</p>
<p>&#8216;Trim-bodiced maiden, hail!&#8217; I cried.</p>
<p>She answered, &#8216;Whither, Wanderer?</p>
<p>For thou hast lost thy way.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Every word went to Ulfar&#8217;s heart, and
amid all the soft cries of delight he alone
was silent. She was beaming with smiles;
she was radiant as a goddess; the light
seemed to vanish from the room when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
went away. Her adieu was a general one,
excepting to Ulfar. On him she turned
her bright eyes, and courtesied low with
one upward glance. It set his heart on
fire. He knew that glance. They might
say this or that, they might lie to him
neck-deep, he knew it was Aspatria! He
was cross with Sarah. He accused her of
downright deception. He told her frankly
that he believed nothing about the soldier
and his sister.</p>
<p>She bade him come in the morning and
talk to Ria; and he asked impetuously:
&#8220;How soon? Twelve, I suppose? How
am I to pass the time until twelve
to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why this haste?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why this deception?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After seven years&#8217; indifference, are you
suddenly gone mad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if I was being very badly
used.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does the real Aspatria feel? Go
at once to Ambar-Side.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The real Aspatria is here. I know it!
I feel it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a court of law, what evidence would
feeling be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a court of love&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, to-morrow, at ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>His impetuosity pleased her. She was
disposed to leave him to Aspatria now.
And Aspatria was disposed on the following
morning to make his confession very
easy to him. She dressed herself in the
simple black gown she had kept ready for
this event. It had the short elbow sleeves,
and the ruffle round the open throat, and
the daffodil against her snowy breast, that
distinguished the first costume he had ever
seen her in. She loosened her hair and
let it fall in two long braids behind her
ears. She was, as far as dress could make
her so, the Aspatria who had held the
light to welcome him to Ambar-Side that
stormy night ten years ago.</p>
<p>He was standing in the middle of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
room, restless and expectant, when she
opened the door. He called her by name,
and went to meet her. She trembled and
was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aspatria, it is you! My Life! My
Soul! It is you!&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her hands; they were as cold
as ice. He drew her close to his side; he
stooped to see her eyes; he whispered word
upon word of affection,&mdash;sweet-meaning
nouns and adjectives that caught a real
physical heat from the impatient heart and
tongue that forged and uttered them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me, my dearest! Forgive me
fully! Forgive me at once and altogether!
Aspatria, I love you! I love none but
you! I will adore you all my life! Speak
one word to me, one word, my love, one
word: say only &#8216;Ulfar!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She forgot in a moment all that she had
suffered. She forgot all she had promised
Sarah, all her intents of coldness, all reproaches;
she forgot even to forgive him.
She just put her arms around his neck and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
kissed him. She blotted out the past forever
in that one whispered word, &#8220;Ulfar.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then he took her to his heart; he
kissed her for very wonder; he kissed her
for very joy; but most of all he kissed her
for fervent love. Then once more life was
an &#8220;Interlude in Heaven.&#8221; Every hour
held some sweet surprise, some accidental
joy. It was Brune, it was Sarah, it was
some eulogium of Ulfar in the great London
weeklies. He had fought in the good
fight for freedom; he had done great
deeds of mercy as well as of valour; he had
crossed primeval forests, and brought back
wonderful medicines, and dyes, and many
new specimens for the botanist and the naturalist.
The papers were never weary in
praising his pluck, his bravery, his generosity,
and his endurance; the Geographical
Society sent him its coveted blue
ribbon. In his own way Ulfar had made
himself a fit mate for the new Aspatria.</p>
<p>And she was a constant wonder to him.
Nothing in all his strange experience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
touched his heart like the thought of his
simple, patient wife, studying to please
him, to be worthy of his love. Every day
revealed her in some new and charming
light. She was one hundred Aspatrias in
a single, lovable, lovely woman. On <ins title='Removed comma'>what</ins>
ever subject Ulfar spoke, she understood,
supplemented, sympathized with, or assisted
him. She could talk in French and
Italian; she was not ignorant of botany
and natural science, and she was delighted
to be his pupil.</p>
<p>In a single month they became all the
world to each other; and then they began
to long for the lonely old castle fronting
the wild North Sea, to plan for its restoration,
and for a sweet home-life, which
alone could satisfy the thirst of their
hearts for each other&#8217;s presence. At the
end of June they went northward.</p>
<p>It was the month of the rose, and the
hedges were pink, and the garden was a
garden of roses. There were banks of
roses, mazes of roses, walks and standards
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
of roses, masses of glorious colour, and
breezes scented with roses. Butterflies were
chasing one another among the flowers;
nightingales, languid with love, were singing
softly above them. And in the midst was
a gray old castle, flying its old border
flags, and looking as happy as if it were
at a festival.</p>
<p>Aspatria was enraptured, spellbound
with delight. With Ulfar she wandered
from one beauty to another, until they
finally reached a great standard of pale-pink
roses. Their loveliness was beyond
compare; their scent went to the brain
like some divine essence. It was a glory,&mdash;a
prayer,&mdash;a song of joy! Aspatria
stood beside it, and seemed to Ulfar but
its mortal manifestation. She was clothed
in a gown of pale-pink brocade, with a
little mantle of the same, trimmed with
white lace, and a bonnet of white lace and
pink roses. She was a perfect rose of
womanhood. She was the glory of his
life, his prayer, his song of joy!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is the loveliest place in the world!&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and you! you are the loveliest
woman! My sweet Aspatria!&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled divinely. &#8220;And yet,&#8221; she
answered, &#8220;I remember, Ulfar, a song of
yours that said something very different.
Listen:&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;There is a rose of a hundred leaves,</p>
<p><i>But the wild rose is the sweetest</i>!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>And as she sang the words, Ulfar had a
vision of a young girl, fresh and pure as a
mountain bluebell, in her scrimp black
frock. He saw the wind blowing it tight
over her virgin form; he saw her fair,
childish, troubled face as she kissed him
farewell in the vicar&#8217;s meadows; and then
he saw the glorious woman, nobly planned,
perfect on every side, that the child wife
had grown to.</p>
<p>So, when she ceased, he pulled the fairest
rose on the tree; he took from it every
thorn, he put it in her breast, he kissed
the rose, and he kissed her rose-like face.
Then he took up the song where she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
dropped it; and hand in hand, keeping
time to its melody, they crossed the threshold
of their blessed home.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The robin sang beneath the eaves:</p>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The nightingale made answer clear:</p>
